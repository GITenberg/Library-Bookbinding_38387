<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>It has been the purpose of the writer in these
chapters on library bookbinding to set forth as
clearly as possible the best information relating to
processes, materials, routine and various other lesser
matters pertaining to bookbinding which must be
taken into consideration by librarians, or by assistants
in charge of binding departments. Although
much of this information exists elsewhere in printed
form, it is scattered through various books and articles.
In some respects, therefore, this book is a
gathering together of scattered material. It is hoped,
however, that there is enough new material to make
the book of interest to those who deal daily with
binding problems, and that the book as a whole may
help to solve some of the questions relating to binding
in libraries both large and small.</p>

<p>Most books on binding and all books on library
binding have devoted some space to paper, its composition,
manufacture, finish and use. As the subject
is so fully dealt with elsewhere it has not been included
here. Those who are interested will find full
information in the technical books on paper, in Mr.
Dana's "Notes on book binding for libraries," and
in Messrs. Coutts and Stephen's "Manual of library
binding." There is also an excellent article on wood pulp<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
paper in the Scientific American of October 4, 1913.</p>

<p>Nor has it seemed desirable to include chapters
on commercial binding nor on historical bindings.
Both of these subjects are treated adequately in
Coutts and Stephen's "Manual." The present writer
has limited his discussion to matters dealing directly
with the binding of books for libraries.</p>

<p>In one or two cases the same subject has been
treated in two different chapters because the subject
matter belonged in both places, and in neither case
would the discussion be complete without it.</p>

<h2>LIBRARY BOOKBINDING</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>An examination of the annual reports of libraries
in the United States shows that from four to eight
per cent of the total income is spent for binding; the
amounts ranging from $2,000 to over $40,000 a year
for this one item. It must be admitted that these are
large sums and that a knowledge of binding materials
and processes is necessary in order to spend this
money wisely. In many libraries the appropriation
for books includes binding and periodicals. It is
evident, therefore, that every dollar saved on binding
can be devoted to the purchase of books. And what
librarian does not desire more money for new books?</p>

<p>In spite of the importance of the subject a great
deal of ignorance has prevailed in years past, and
far too many librarians of the present day fail to
realize that here is one place where money can be
easily wasted. Possibly one reason for the ignorance
about binding is that, except in a minor degree, it
does not directly affect the public, for librarians are
quick to make changes which will increase the interest
of the public in the library. Another reason is
that experiments are necessary; and since it takes
time to draw conclusions from experiments, definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
rules have not been formulated.</p>

<p>In fact, experiments are still being tried. But
while in the past they were along the line of
making books stronger, the experiments of the present
are rather along the line of adapting different
methods to different books, according to the paper
on which they are printed, or according to the kind
of use they will receive. It is reasonably safe to
say that present methods of the best library binders
make a book as strong as it is possible to make it.
Progress no longer lies along the line of strength.</p>

<p>In order to administer a binding department
wisely, the librarian or assistant in charge of binding
must know materials, processes, and books; and
especially must he know how books should be bound
to meet the use they are to receive. For example,
fiction that is very popular should be bound differently
from fiction which must be kept on the shelves,
but which is not popular; it is easily apparent that
McCutcheon's "Graustark" should be bound differently
from Henry James' "Golden bowl." Heavy
reference books constantly consulted should be bound
differently from reference books used only occasionally,
while it may be wise to bind magazines differently
from either. A librarian of a reference library
will adopt methods differing from those which are
used in public libraries. A good working knowledge
of materials and processes can be easily obtained.
The saving of expense comes in applying them to
use.</p>

<p>A recent advertisement of a binder stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
his books were rebound more times than the books
of any other binder. This statement is a sad commentary
on the serviceability of his books and calls
to mind a practice of twenty years ago which is too
prevalent even at the present time. At that time it
was the recognized custom to bind as cheaply as
possible books which circulated rapidly and wore out
quickly. Those who favor this custom fail to realize
that in the case of books which are constantly used
the actual cost of binding does not depend on the
initial cost per volume, but on the ratio of cost to
circulation. This is a point first brought out by
Mr. J. C. Dana in his "Notes on bookbinding for
libraries," and one on which it is impossible to lay
too much emphasis. A book which costs 35c. to
bind and which circulates 35 times has cost one cent
for each time it has been issued after rebinding;
while a book which has cost 50c. to bind and has
been issued 100 times (a fair average for a 50c. binding)
costs one half cent for each time it has been
issued. Obviously the 50c. binding is much cheaper.
It is probable that the 35c. book must either be rebound
at an additional expense of 35c. or else a new
copy must be purchased at a cost of $1, while the
50c. binding may carry the book to a point where it
can be discarded absolutely. Certainly it should
never be rebound again. It is important, therefore,
that the librarian who does not know what his binding
is costing per issue should keep statistics of
circulation for a sufficient length of time to obtain
general averages which will be fairly accurate.</p>

<p>While a very strong binding is necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
fiction and juvenile books in public libraries, it is
probable that on many books of a serious character
some of the strengthening processes which must be
used on fiction and juveniles may be omitted. It
should be noted that while this is true of public
libraries, the reverse would probably be true in college
and reference libraries where a much larger
proportion of serious books should be bound as
strongly as possible.</p>

<p>There are three general kinds of binding:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Commercial, or edition binding.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Artistic binding.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Library binding.</p>

<p>Commercial binding is that in which practically
all books come from the publishers. For the most
part it is the product of machinery from beginning
to end, and the material used is generally poor.
Apparently the sole object in view of most publishers
is to turn out a book that will attract the eye.
Strength is not an element for which they strive.
From their point of view they cannot be severely
blamed for making strength a secondary consideration.
By far the largest part of their product is sold
to individuals, and the strength of the binding is
adequate for the amount of use that these books will
receive. From the library point of view, however,
publishers' bindings are entirely inadequate. One
cannot expect, of course, that the publisher will put
a popular novel into a binding strong enough to
meet the demands of library use. On the other
hand, one cannot blame librarians for being exasperated
when heavy books of travel, history, or
biography part from their covers when they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
been in the hands of less than ten readers.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristics of commercial
binding, and at the same time its greatest weaknesses,
are the machine sewing and the insecure way
in which the book is fastened into the cover. Very
little extra expense either in material, care, or workmanship,
would make most books outside of fiction
sufficiently strong to withstand all the wear that
they will receive. Unfortunately the publishers fail
to realize this, and books by the thousands come
from the binderies covered on the back with the
coarsest kind of super which does not even extend
to the head or tail of the book. A stouter cloth,
carefully applied, running the entire length of the
back would cost very little more per volume, but
would strengthen it materially.</p>

<p>While practically all commercial binding is lacking
in strength, this is due almost wholly to trade
conditions, for commercial binding can be made
exceedingly strong. One has only to turn to the
1912 edition of the Century Dictionary or to the
United States Catalog, which are practically machine
bound throughout, to realize this fact. However,
until librarians are united in their demands for
stronger bindings, we can expect to see the present
poor work turned out in as large quantities as ever.</p>

<p>There is another kind of binding which is, if
possible, even more unsuitable for libraries. This is
artistic binding which is done exclusively for individuals,
beauty of appearance being the chief object
in view. It differs from commercial binding in being
all hand work instead of machine work. Since hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
work is used and the main object in view is beauty,
it follows, of course, that such books are much
stronger than those bound by publishers. But the
strength of these books is in many cases not proof
against the wear that they would receive in libraries.
No special methods of sewing or strengthening the
first and last sections are used. Practically all artistic
books are bound in leather and frequently in full
leather. Whenever the leather used is anything
other than good morocco, it is an element of weakness
rather than strength. In addition to these objections,
artistic bindings are usually so expensive as
to be beyond the reach of any library.</p>

<p>In library binding the main consideration is
strength. Not only is beauty a secondary consideration,
it is scarcely taken into consideration at all.
For it must be confessed that library bindings are
seldom attractive. No library can afford to pay for
ornamentation of backs and sides of books. Library
binding is all hand work. Although machine binding
can be made exceedingly strong, machines cannot
be used on library binding, because the books
vary so much in size and lettering. The main reason
why commercial binding can be done by machinery
is because a large number of books are bound
exactly alike. In library binding it seldom happens
that more than two volumes, the same in size and
lettering, are bound at the same time. Library binding
also differs from other bindings in that the use
the book is to receive is made the basis of selection
of materials and methods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>SELECTION OF A BINDER</h3>

<p>Since library binding differs widely from other
kinds of binding, it follows naturally that it is best
to have this work done by men who understand its
special requirements. Unfortunately, there are comparatively
few binders who make a specialty of this
kind of work. Librarians of most of the smaller
libraries are forced by local prejudice to give their
work to the local binder or to the nearest outside
binder in order to save the expense of transportation.
If the work is sent to the local binder, it must
be sent to one who is doing other kinds of binding
and to whom the library work is, in a way, a minor
consideration. He would object if the work were
sent out of town, but the total amount of the library
work is small compared with his other work. Such
binders usually have one way for binding all books
(except those which come under the head of blank-book
work) and the library books go through the
regular process of being sewed on twine and put
into covers with no special reinforcements. The
materials used are not the best and the workmanship
is generally poor. Local binders, realizing that the
funds are usually inadequate for the needs of the
library, frequently do this work at a price which at
first sight seems cheap. When, however, the poor
service which the bindings give is taken into consideration<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
the price is really very high. Many of these
binders have been in business for years; and although
they may be good workmen and do honest
work, they are very sure that they know more about
binding than any librarian, and it is with difficulty
that they can be prevailed upon to adopt suggestions.</p>

<p>It is only fair, of course, that a library which is
supported either in whole or in part by public funds
should, when possible, have its work done by residents
of the town. For this reason, therefore, the
librarian should learn in just what ways good library
binding differs from other binding. All the good
materials and processes, and all the various methods
of strengthening a book should be studied carefully
so that the binder can be told exactly how the work
should be done. The binder will probably rebel, but
perhaps he can be converted and the effort is worth
while.</p>

<p>If the binder fails to grasp the ideas of the librarian,
or refuses to carry them out, the work should
be sent out of town to a good binder, for deference
to local prejudice does not require that the efficiency
of the library be impaired. When work is
sent out of town the librarian is somewhat at a disadvantage,
for no examination of the work can be
made while the books are in process. That the
binder chosen should do honest work goes without
saying. The work of a dishonest or incompetent
binder always shows in the poor service which the
books give, but inasmuch as dishonest work is generally
covered up, it takes time to discover it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Therefore, great care must be taken to select a good
binder in the first place. Librarians who are in
doubt should consult the librarians of large libraries,
or apply to the Binding committee of the American
Library Association for the names of reliable binders.</p>

<p>While librarians should be able to give suggestions
to binders who are not accustomed to library
binding, and failing that should exercise good judgment
in selecting a binder at a distance, they should
not expect the impossible. The writer has seen books
sent to binders which were in such bad condition
that no binder could bind them satisfactorily. Some
librarians expect too much of a binder; others do
not realize that they are not demanding all that they
should receive.</p>

<p>Having selected a competent binder the librarian
should not insist that unimportant details be done
according to his own ideas. If the binder understands
that he may have the work only so long as
he follows the specifications faithfully, one may
safely leave the details to him.</p>

<p>It should further be borne in mind that good
binding is seldom obtained at low prices. A library
book well bound requires good material, good workmanship
and special reinforcements which take time.
Since the largest part of the cost of a book is due
to the labor spent on it, it follows that low prices
can prevail only in those localities where the cost of
labor is below the standard.</p>

<p>Since workmanship has as much to do with good
binding as specifications it is not wise to submit<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
specifications to different binders for bids. It is
better to ask binders to submit samples of their work
with specifications of the way in which the books
are bound. If, however, it seems wise to ask for
bids, it is far from wise to choose the lowest bidder
unless absolutely assured that the workmanship and
material will be satisfactory.</p>

<h3>PROCESSES</h3>


<p>The processes of bookbinding have been so fully
covered in the books of Messrs. Cockerell, Zaehnsdorf,
Crane, and others, that the need of further
material of a similar character is not readily apparent.
The only excuse the writer has to offer for
discussing the matter of processes at any length is
that there seems to exist nowhere any description of
the processes that are used in the best library binderies.
Mr. Dana in his "Notes on bookbinding for
libraries" touches only certain points of the processes
here and there. Mr. Stephen in Coutts and Stephen's
"Manual of library binding" has a chapter on hand
bookbinding, but confines himself closely to the general
processes that have been in vogue for years; the
modifications used in library binding are not touched
upon. In other words the works of Cockerell,
Zaehnsdorf, Crane and others are too full, while descriptions
in books devoted to library binding are not
full enough.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to cover somewhat
in detail the main processes as they are carried
out in the best library binderies. Explanations of the
technical terms used will be found in the list of
technical terms at the end of the book.</p>

<p>Without discussing the composition of paper it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
necessary to state that the paper of a book has a very
important effect upon its binding. Its thickness, tensile
strength, firmness, toughness, strength after being
sawed or perforated for sewing, and strength after
folding, all have an effect on its durability. Especial
emphasis must be laid upon strength after folding,
for it must be remembered that it is through the
fold that the book is sewed. If a crease or a fold in
a piece of paper weakens that piece of paper, it will
be impossible to make a strong book by sewing in the
ordinary way. If a fold has very little effect upon the
strength of the paper ordinary sewing may be satisfactory.
The folding of paper in 95 per cent of fiction
and juvenile books weakens it at the fold over
50 per cent. In a good piece of paper the fold weakens
it not over 5 per cent.</p>

<p>The problem of paper is a modern one, due to
the use of wood pulp and other short-fibred materials
in paper manufacture. All binders complain bitterly
of the impossibility of binding it properly. The librarian,
however, should know the way in which it can
be bound to give the maximum amount of service
and should not allow a binder to blame the paper for
faults which are due to his ignorance or to poor
workmanship.</p>
<p>While the customs of library binders vary somewhat
according to the prejudices of the different men,
the following description covers the binding processes
carried out at most binderies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">1. Taking Apart</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
</p>

<p>After the books have been checked with the statement
of the librarian to see that the correct number
has been received, each one is taken apart carefully
and all old threads, glue, paste, etc., removed from
the back. If the book is in a regular machine sewed
publisher's cover it will be comparatively easy to remove
old threads and glue from the back. If in an
old hand sewed one, it may be a little more difficult.</p>

<p>The book is first removed from the cover. The
first signature is then turned back and threads cut
with a sharp knife. Generally this will loosen the
signature so that it can be separated easily from the
rest of the volume. If it is still held by glue and
there is danger of injuring the back of the signature,
a bone folder is used. If the book had a tight back
and the leather, back-lining paper and glue form a
very firm back not easily separated in the manner described,
the glue may be softened with paste or warm
water, with care necessary to prevent the dampness
from penetrating the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2. Collation</span></p>

<p>The book should then be collated. The best
library binders make themselves responsible for
page collation but they do not bother to see that all
plates, illustrations, maps, etc., which may be called
for by the table of contents, are in proper place. In
the case of periodicals they do not always discover
the fact that certain parts, not included in the main
paging, are missing. Their collation is that of main
paging only. Periodicals must, therefore, have title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
page, table of contents and index in their proper
places. Books with two or more main pagings or
many unpaged illustrations must be collated at the
library. (See Preparing for the bindery, <a href="#Page_125">p. 125.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">3. Knocking Down</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Backs of signatures are then pounded down
so that they may be as nearly as possible the same
thickness as the front of the signatures. Care must
be taken to have a clean hammer and to let it fall
evenly on the paper. If the backs are not properly
pounded down there is likely to be too much swell in
the back of the book when it is finally sewed. In all
the first processes of binding the question of undue
swelling of the back must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If the book must be overcast when it comes
to be sewed, the back is not only pounded down at
this stage, but it is also put under the knife and entirely
cut off, leaving single leaves instead of folded
sections. If it is not pounded it cannot be cut properly.
The success of overcasting depends largely on
the amount of margin at the back, so that care must
be taken not to cut more than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">4. Mending</span></p>
<p>Leaves are mended with thin tough paper. The
librarian should not, however, expect binders to mend
books which have a large number of torn leaves
without making an extra charge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">5. Gluing</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Books which are to be overcast and which have
had the backs cut off are slightly glued to hold the
leaves together. A sufficient number can then be
taken off and handled as a section without coming
apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">6. Fly Leaves Guarded</span></p>

<p>Fly-leaves, made of kraft or manila paper running
about 60 pounds to the ream, which have previously
been guarded with cloth are added to the book. In
guarding, a strip of cloth is pasted around the back
of the folded fly-leaf covering about one quarter of
an inch on each side. When the book is sewed the
needle passes through the cloth as well as the paper.
Different binders use different materials for guarding
fly-leaves, end papers and signatures. It must,
however, be a cloth of close weave, strong, and light
in weight. The English cloth called jaconet, used by
some binders, is probably as satisfactory as any.</p>

<p>This is one part of library binding which differs
radically from the custom in ordinary hand work.
Old-fashioned binders, unless properly instructed, will
simply fold a piece of paper, and tip it on to the first
and last signatures with paste, thus forming an element
of weakness instead of strength. When the
fly-leaves are guarded and properly sewed they become
an integral part of the book and no tipping is
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">7. Sections Guarded</span></p>

<p>At this point it is also necessary to guard the first
and last signatures of books which are to be sewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in the regular way. Overcast books do not need such
guards.</p>

<p>Guarding of first and last signatures is another
of the distinctive features of library binding. In the
case of books bound in the regular fashion the sewing
invariably first gives way at the first and last signatures.
Guarding with jaconet prevents the threads
which lie in the middle of the signatures from pulling
through the paper. This method is essential if it
is supposed that the book will be much used. It
is not essential for books which will be used only
occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">8. Illustrations Guarded</span></p>

<p>Illustrations are guarded with a thin, tough paper,
not with cloth. The guard folds around an adjoining
signature and is sewed through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">9. Sawing</span></p>

<p>If the book is not to be overcast, it is screwed
tightly into the backing-press and sawed to make the
grooves in which the bands or twines are laid when
the book is sewed. Grooves for three bands must
be made for books eight inches high, four for
twelve-inch books and five for fifteen-inch books.
For fiction two bands are used. There must also
be two additional grooves, much shallower than the
others, about one half inch from the head and tail of
the book for the kettlestitch.</p>

<p>After the grooves for kettlestitch have been sawed
the two grooves for bands will divide the rest of the
back into three equal parts. For fine work it is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
to measure the book carefully and mark with
a pencil; but in most library work measurement by
the eye alone is sufficient. In sawing, care must be
taken not to saw too deeply, since too deep a cut
allows the signature to play back and forth and is
plainly visible inside.</p>

<p>There are some good library binders who overcast
books in the modern way, and yet who sew on
bands. Such binders will at this point saw all books.
There are also some good library binders who use no
bands when overcasting and who sew all other books
on tapes. These binders omit sawing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">10. End Papers Added</span></p>

<p>At this point it is best to add end papers. These
are always guarded on the outside of the fold and
sometimes on the inside. They should be made of
good, strong paper somewhat heavier than that used
for fly-leaves. Some binders have special papers
made to order with a design which serves as a trade
mark. End papers, in the same way as fly-leaves, are
prepared with guards in quantity and simply need to
be trimmed to the size of the book. They are not
added at the same time as fly-leaves because they
must not be sawed. If this is done the holes show
through after the end paper is pasted down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">11. Sewing</span></p>

<p><i>Regular or Bench Sewing.</i> When the signatures
are ready for sewing, twines (or "bands" as they are
commonly called) are stretched taut on the sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
bench and adjusted so that they will fit into the saw-cuts
in signatures. (Fig. 1.)</p>

</div>

<p>The book is placed back of the sewing bench with
the fore-edge toward the sewer and with the first
section on top. The first section (i. e. the end paper)
to be sewed is then turned over, opened in the middle
by the left hand, and placed on the sewing bench.
The sewer, as she faces toward the right, with the
right hand passes the needle from the outside through
the sawcut for the kettlestitch, where it is taken by
the left hand along the inside of the section and
passed out on the near side of the first band, then in
again on the far side of the first band, along the inside
of the section to the second band, where the
process is repeated; and so on, bringing the needle
out in the far kettlestitch. (Fig. 2.) The thread is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
pulled tight at each stitch and about two inches of
thread is allowed to hang from the first kettlestitch.
In some few cases it may be advisable to bring the
needle out on the far side of the band and in again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
on the near side, thus entirely encircling the band
with the thread. The next section (i. e. the fly-leaves)
is then laid on and the process repeated, except
that the sewing proceeds from the far end to
the near end. When the thread is brought out of the
kettle stitch of the second section the end of the
thread left projecting from the first section is securely
tied to it, and the sewer proceeds with the third section.
This will be the first signature of the book. On
reaching the last sawcut at the far end in the third
section the needle is put between the second and first
sections carrying the thread down in such a way as
to form a buttonhole stitch. (Fig. 3.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="350" height="114" alt="Figure 3.&mdash;Kettle stitch." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 3.&mdash;Kettle stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>All other signatures are sewed in the same way,
the last section sewed being securely fastened to the
others. It is possible to sew a number of books one
after another without removing them from the sewing-bench.
If the back swells unduly the sections can
be pounded down with a piece of wood, care being
taken not to drive them inward. The sewing should
be neither too loose nor too tight. If too loose a firm,
compact book cannot be made; if too tight the
threads may break in the process of backing. Bands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
are allowed to project about an inch on each side of
the book.</p>

<p>Formerly it was the practice of some binders to
sew in a way technically called "two-on." This
simply means that the sewer when reaching the
middle of the signature, passes the needle into the
corresponding sawcut of the signature above and
sews through to the other end. This always leaves
an end of a signature unsewed. This way of sewing
is permissible on books which have a large number
of thin signatures, in order to prevent the thread
from unduly swelling the back. It is never permissible
on other books.</p>

<p>The foregoing account gives a very brief description
of ordinary sewing. It is easily understood
when once seen. Librarians who have charge of
binding should keep the process thoroughly in mind
for it is the most important single process in the
making of a book. Such sewing will be used on a
large number of books which have to be rebound, but
a still larger number, practically all fiction and juvenile
books, should be sewed in a different manner;
that is, with some kind of an overcast stitch.</p>

<p><i>Overcasting.</i> The modern overcasting stitch resembles
in principle the old-fashioned whipstitching,
but differs radically in actual performance. It is
exceedingly strong, while the old-fashioned whipstitching
is not. It has been objected that modern
overcasting takes away much of the flexibility of a
book and that books once sewed in this way can never
be rebound. It is true that an oversewed book is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as flexible as one sewed through the signatures, yet
most of them are more flexible than one might suppose.
It is also true that the book can never be rebound,
but if the overcasting is properly done, the
sewing will last until the book is discarded. It is for
this reason that it is used on practically all fiction and
juvenile books.</p>

<p>According to the old-fashioned method of whipstitching
it was the custom to cut off the backs of
signatures, glue them slightly, take a few leaves and
sew them over and over making five or six stitches
to a section, as shown in Figure 4. The next section
was then sewed in the same way, but it was not
joined in any way to the section beneath except by
the kettlestitch and occasionally by a little paste.
When sewed in this way the leaves inside of each
arbitrary section would open only as far back as the
threads of the stitches, while between the sections the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
book would open to the back of the section. If paste
had been used the strain of opening tended to pull the
leaves apart. If the book was subjected to hard wear
the thread cut into the paper.</p>

sewed separately." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 4.&mdash;Old-fashioned whipstitching. Each section is

</div>

<p>Today every progressive library binder has a
special method of overcasting and each claims that
his method is the best. Librarians, however, can see
many points of resemblance between them, and few
points of difference. In actual wearing qualities the
sewing of one seems as good as that of another.
When properly done the sewing prescribed by all of
the methods is still in good condition when the books
have to be withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<p>In overcasting, as in old-fashioned whipstitching,
the sewer selects a certain number of sheets for sewing.
Bands are placed on the sewing-bench as in
regular sewing, though some binders claim that it
is not necessary to sew either on bands or tapes.
The sections are first perforated by a machine to
facilitate the work of the sewer and to insure that all
stitches shall be equidistant from the back of the
book. So far as is known no machine for this purpose
is on the market. It is certain, however, that
the best binders have machines for this purpose.
They have either designed their own machines or
have adapted those made for other purposes. If the
book is printed on thick, spongy paper it will increase
flexibility if the paper is creased along the line of
perforation.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 5.&mdash;One kind of modern overcast stitch. There are
others equally good. Note that each stitch extends
through two sections.</span>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to give a description of modern
overcasting which can be easily understood by one<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
unfamiliar with sewing processes. The reader will
be helped by looking closely at Figure 5 while reading
the following description, but one can understand
it best by seeing it done or by tearing a book apart
and examining the sewing.</p>

<p>The first section of the book is sewed over and
over in the same way as in the old-fashioned method
of whipstitching, except that a great many more
stitches are taken. The second section, when placed
on the first, is also sewed over and over but a certain
number of stitches are also made which connect the
second section with the first. In the same way the
third section is sewed to the second and so on through
the book, so that when the book is finally sewed it is
tight and compact; its weakness lies in the paper itself,
not in the sewing. Some binders add three
kettlestitches at the end of the book instead of one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
believing that when all kettlestitches are placed in one
sawcut the swell at the head and tail of the book is
too great.</p>

<p>Overcasting is the most expensive way of sewing
a book, so that it is advantageous to binders to place
as large a number of leaves as possible in a section.
The more careful binders, however, regulate the number
of leaves in a section according to the kind of
paper in the book. A larger number of leaves can
be taken in books printed on thin paper than in those<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
printed on thick, spongy or heavy papers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="158" height="392" alt="Figure 8.&mdash;Stitching." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 8.&mdash;Stitching.</span>
</div>
<p>In deciding how a book ought to be sewed one
must consider: (<i>a</i>) The use the book is to receive.
If it will not receive hard usage sew through the signatures;
otherwise overcast. (<i>b</i>) Paper on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the book is printed. Poor paper should be oversewed.
(Fig. 6.)</p>

<p><i>Tapes.</i> When it does not seem necessary to overcast
it may be advantageous to sew on tapes instead
of bands. This method eliminates saw-cuts since the
narrow tapes are simply laid against the back of the
book and the needle passed around them, as indicated
in Figure 7. Sewing on tapes makes a book much
more flexible than it can be made any other way except
by sewing on raised bands. Music should always
be sewed in this way. Until recently it was supposed
that tapes added strength, but it is certain that they
do not if the book is properly bound in other respects.
If used at all, tapes should be narrow. Wide ones
take up a great deal of surface and when glue is applied
this surface remains untouched, unless the sewer
has sewed through them instead of around them.</p>

<p><i>Stitching.</i> Stitching is the process of sewing
loose leaves lengthwise on a sewing machine, after
which the stitched sections are sewed in the regular
way on bands. (Fig. 8.) The objection made to
old-fashioned whipstitching, that between the sections
the book opens all the way to the back while inside
the section it opens only as far as the threads, is
equally applicable to a stitched book. Any one who
has read a book sewed in this way will remember how
difficult it was to hold in the hands. Stitching makes
a stronger book than the old-fashioned whipstitching
but cannot compare in strength with the modern
overcasting. In some few cases it may be used advantageously
on the first and last signatures of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
book, but its use on the entire book cannot be too
strongly condemned.</p>

<p>It may be inferred by what has been said about
sewing that it is a comparatively simple matter to sew
books properly. It is right at this point, however,
that the librarian and the binder who does not understand
the requirements of library work will come into
conflict. The binder will insist that all books must be
sewed on bands. When the backs of sections are
very badly worn he will agree to whipstitch, but will
use the old method. The librarian will insist not only
that nine-tenths of fiction and juvenile books must be
overcast, but that a special kind of overcasting must
be used. The binders who make a specialty of library
work do all this as a matter of course. At least one
binder tests the thickness, tensile strength and other
qualities of the paper and sews each book in the way
that experience has shown to be the best.</p>


<h3>FORWARDING</h3>

<p>After the book is sewed it goes to the forwarder
who has charge of the book during all processes
which the book passes through between sewing and
finishing. Forwarding includes trimming, gluing,
rounding, backing, putting on back-lining, making
the case (or lacing-in, see page 42), casing-in,
pressing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">12. Fly Leaves Pasted</span></p>

<p>The end papers and fly-leaves which lie together
are pasted together, making one thick fly-leaf. When
it is remembered that both end papers and fly-leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
are guarded with cloth, it will be seen that pasting
the two together adds materially to the strength of
the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">13. Bands Frayed</span></p>

<p>The bands which project about an inch and a half
on each side of the book are frayed out at the end and
pasted to the end papers. The fraying is done so that
they will paste down flat, and the pasting so that they
will be out of the way during succeeding processes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">14. Trimming</span></p>

<p>The book is squared up by tapping on a flat surface,
and trimmed at the head, fore-edge and tail. As
little as possible must be trimmed, but binders find
that if less than an eighth of an inch is cut the cutting
machine does not work well. Trimming makes the
edges even and what is more important in rebound
books, removes much dirt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">15. Sprinkling</span></p>

<p>At this point edges are sprinkled. This process
is not essential either for strength or beauty, but it
helps to keep the book from becoming soiled, or at
least from showing dirt. It cannot be expected on
cheap work. The process was formerly done by
hand, using a brush and shaking the coloring matter
on the book. It can now be done with a machine
operated by hand which sprays the coloring matter
on the book. Occasionally the top of the book is burnished
with an agate or blood stone.</p>

<p>Occasionally also it may be desirable to gild the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
top of a book which is being rebound. When this
occurs it is not a process to which the librarian need
give much attention, except to be sure that good gold
is used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">16. Gluing</span></p>

<p>The back of the book is then slightly glued. The
glue must be very hot and quite thin, and must be
thoroughly worked into the back. By placing books
in a pile a number can be done at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">17. Rounding</span></p>

<p>As soon as the glue has stiffened but before it is
hard the book is rounded. This must be done by experts
and is a process which must be seen to be
understood. The book is placed on the table with the
fore edge toward the workman who then hammers
the part of the back lying uppermost in such a way as
to force the upper part of the book toward the workman.
The book is then turned over and the process
repeated. After a few operations like this the back
of the book becomes rounded and the fore edge
concave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">18. Backing</span></p>

<p>The book is then placed in a backing press allowing
about an eighth of an inch to project, and screwed
very tight. With a backing hammer the rounding
process is continued and the sides of the book forced
down over the edge of the press to form a projection
against which the edge of the board for the side rests,
forming the joint. In hammering, the workman begins
at the proper distance from the center of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
back so that he can force the backs of the other signatures
over on each side toward the edge. (Fig. 9.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="333" height="294" alt="Figure 9.&mdash;A book rounded and backed." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 9.&mdash;A book rounded and backed.</span>
</div>

<p>This process is the most important one in forwarding,
calling for skilled labor. If the hammer is
not used in exactly the right way the backs of the
signatures may be crushed in, the stitches broken, or
the paper or bands cut. In any case the book is materially
weakened. A good workman will make a sharp
joint and round the book perfectly without injuring
its strength in any way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">19. Back Lining</span></p>

<p>All books have a lining of one kind or another on
the back. Machine-bound books are generally lined
with a coarse "super," as it is called in this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
or "mull" as it is called in England. Some library
binders use a thin muslin, but the best material is canton
flannel cut in strips wide enough to cover the
back of the book and also to project about one inch
on each side. The back of the book is glued, while
the nap or fuzzy side of the canton flannel is pasted
and then put on the back and well rubbed down. It
is very important that both the glue and the paste be
used. Experience has proved that when only one is
used the canton flannel will come off, but when both
are used, it becomes an integral part of the book.</p>

<p>The flannel which projects on the sides must be
pasted to the end papers. When the paste and the
glue have dried, the canton flannel shrinks tight to
the back and adds materially to the strength of the
book. After drying the flannel is trimmed at the
head and tail close to the back.</p>

<p>If the book is a valuable one that will receive hard
usage and therefore should be as strong as possible,
the flesh side of a piece of split goat skin can be used
for back-lining, covering the back from joint to joint.
It will seldom be necessary, however, to employ this
method.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing better shows the difference between
old methods of library binding and new than
this one item of back-lining. In the old methods the
binders depended for strength largely upon the bands.
In the new the bands are practically immaterial when
the book is fastened into the cover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">20. Rebacking</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point some binders reback to make a sharp
joint, and to make the book open more easily. When
the canton flannel dries it may pull the back somewhat
out of shape. It is doubtful, however, if rebacking is
always necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">21. Boards Cut</span></p>

<p>The book is then measured for boards which are
cut to the proper size. In measuring it must be remembered
that the boards must project an eighth of
an inch on all edges (except the back) forming what
is called the "squares." It will also make a difference
in measuring if the book is to have a French joint.
(See page 46.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">22. Cloth Cut</span></p>

<p>If the book is to be bound in cloth, this is cut the
proper size. If leather backs are to be used the covering
material consists of two pieces of cloth and one
of leather, all of which must be cut to the proper size.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">23. Loose Back</span></p>

<p>If the book is to be made a loose back, a piece
of coarse paper is cut the size of the book from joint
to joint and the length of the back. This is placed
in the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">24. Making the Case</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The cloth for a full cloth book is now glued
all over on the inside. The boards are adjusted on
the book ("setting the square," as the binders call it)
as they ought to be when the book is finally bound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and the book is placed on the right-hand side of the
glued cloth, with the back toward the middle of the
case, leaving enough cloth projecting on all sides to
turn in. The other side of the case is then drawn up
over the board on top and pressed down firmly
enough so that when it is laid back again, the board
which has been uppermost goes with it. The book
itself is laid aside. The paper which is to prevent the
glued cloth from sticking to the back of the book is
then placed in the space between the two boards, and
all edges of the cloth turned in on the boards. This
forms the complete cover or case.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If the book is to have a leather back, the
boards are tipped lightly with paste to the end papers,
allowing for the French joint. The leather is pasted
and the book is then laid on the leather in the right
position so that the rest of the leather can be pulled
up over the back on the top board. The top cover is
then laid back, the paper forming a loose back inserted,
the leather turned in, and cloth sides put on
and turned in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">25. Making of a French Joint</span></p>

<p>The book is now set back in the cover just described
and the space between the boards and the
back is creased with a bone folder while the cloth or
leather is damp. This forms the French joint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">26. Pasting Down End Papers</span></p>

<p>End papers are then pasted down to the boards
and the book, so far as strength is concerned, is finished.
It will be remembered that the end papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
were guarded with muslin, or jaconet, that the bands
projected beyond the sides and were pasted to the end
papers, and that the canton flannel also projected
beyond the sides and was pasted to the end papers.
Therefore, when the end paper is pasted to the board
it carries with it first the canton flannel, then the
bands and lastly the jaconet guard. This is as true
of leather-backed books as of full cloth.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, this makes what is technically
known as a "cased" book, i. e., the case is made in
one whole piece and the book fastened into it. Because
leather bound books have always been considered
stronger than others, and because they have
always been laced-in to the boards (see page 42)
before the leather has been put on, a prejudice
against cased books has arisen. If the prejudice be
directed against the usual commercial binding it is
justified, but if directed against library books properly
cased it is not justified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">27. Pressing</span></p>

<p>At this stage the book is put under heavy pressure
in the standing press until dry. A number of books
are placed in the press at one time, separated by
backing boards having metal projections which fit
into the French joints. They should be left twelve
hours at least, longer if necessary. After pressing,
the book goes through a general cleaning process. In
applying the glue or paste there are many chances of
soiling the book. The great pressure which is applied
also squeezes out glue at the head and tail. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
must all be cleaned off before the book goes to the
finisher.</p>


<h3>FINISHING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">28. Gilding</span></p>

<p>The gilding of a library book is a simple matter
compared with that of books bound for individuals.
Such books are usually meant to be artistic and their
covers bear elaborate designs in gold, generally limited
only by the size of the owner's pocketbook or by
his taste.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In library binding gilding is confined to
the furnishing of necessary information. Tooling of
all kinds, with the possible exception of that which
divides the back into panels, is unnecessary. A description
of finishing processes is unnecessary here
since they add nothing to the strength of a book. A
description of the method of gilding call numbers will
be found on page 194.</p>

<p>There are three different ways of lettering books
bound in light colored cloths on which gold cannot
be used: (<i>a</i>) In gold on leather labels pasted to the
back. (<i>b</i>) In gold on panels which have been stained
black. (<i>c</i>) In black ink directly on the back. The
first two methods make more attractive-looking books
but the process adds to the expense, and in the first
case the labels have a tendency to peel off. The last
method is the one generally used.</p>

<br>

<p>In this description of processes numerous details
have been omitted, because they would add little, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
anything, to the librarian's ability to criticize properly
the work being done by his binder.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In some respects
the order here outlined may differ in different
binderies, but the majority follow it closely.</p>

<p>The processes as outlined are those which should
be used in library binding. There are, however, several
additional points relating to binding processes
with which it is well to be familiar.</p>

<h3>RAISED BANDS</h3>

<p>In looking at many old books bound in the
eighteenth or early part of the nineteenth century,
or at books bound within recent years for individuals,
one will find many that have the back divided by
ridges. These are known as "raised bands." They
are formed by sewing the book differently from
either of the methods described up to this point.</p>

<p>According to this method the bands are not placed
in grooves which sink them below the surface of the
back, but are simply laid against the back. In sewing
the thread may come out at the near side of the band
and in at the far side, thus going around the band
on the back of the book; or it may come out at the
far side and in at the near side, thus entirely encircling
the band. In either case the sewing is exceedingly
strong. Since the bands are entirely on the
surface, the leaves open all the way to the back of
the signatures and greater flexibility can be obtained
thereby. (Fig. 10.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span></p>

</div>

<p>As it is much more difficult to sew and forward
books with raised bands, they are not used in ordinary
library work. It may be advisable, however, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
use them occasionally on a few large reference books
such as dictionaries, where great flexibility combined
with strength is essential. In fact the merits of
binding in this way are not recognized as generally
as they should be.</p>

<p>Many books look as if they were sewed on raised
bands when in reality they are sewed in the ordinary
way, with false raised bands pasted on the back.
They add nothing to strength and have no place in
library binding.</p>


<h3>LACING-IN</h3>

<p>Lacing-in is a method of attaching the bands to
the book, which is in general use for all leather books
bound by hand. This method requires that the
boards which have been cut to the proper size be laid
against the grooves formed in backing and marks be
made about half an inch in from the back, opposite
each band. At these points holes are punched through
the board which is then turned over and other holes
are punched about half an inch from the first ones.
It is generally desirable to cut a groove in the board
from the first holes to the edge of the board, for the
bands to lie in, so that there will not be an unsightly
protuberance when the book is bound. The bands
which have been frayed out are then threaded through
the first holes from the outside of the board inward
and again through the second holes. They are drawn
up tightly enough so that the board will fit close to
the joint, but not enough to prevent it from lying flat.
The ends of the bands are spread out fan-wise,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
pasted, and hammered down smooth on the board.
Before any back-lining has been put on, the boards
are attached to the book simply by these bands.
(Fig. 11.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="350" height="190" alt="Figure 11.&mdash;Bands laced in, and ends frayed out. Based on
illustration in Report of the Committee on Leather for
Bookbinding. Edited for Society of Arts, London, 1905." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 11.&mdash;Bands laced in, and ends frayed out. Based on
illustration in Report of the Committee on Leather for
Bookbinding. Edited for Society of Arts, London, 1905.</span>
</div>

<p>When bands are laced-in it is not customary to
use anything stronger than paper for back lining;
the strength of the book lies in the bands and the
leather which covers the back. As long as the leather
remains strong and the book does not receive hard
usage this method is satisfactory. As soon, however,
as the leather begins to disintegrate more strain is
placed upon the bands. When the leather breaks
completely the bands bear the entire burden at the
joint, and eventually break. With the process as outlined
in the preceding pages one need never fear that
the book will come out of the cover, or that the sides
will break at the joint. Even if the leather should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
break the canton flannel will hold. The best library
binders do no lacing-in at the present time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i052.jpg" width="350" height="146" alt="Figure 12.&mdash;Split boards. In actual work the back-lining
would cover the entire back." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 12.&mdash;Split boards. In actual work the back-lining
would cover the entire back.</span>
</div>


<h3>SPLIT BOARDS</h3>

<p>While the old method of lacing-in is not desirable
in library binding, the method of using split boards
makes a very strong book. Instead of making a case
of cloth, or cloth and leather, the back lining and the
bands (or tapes) are inserted in boards which have
been split, or between two thin boards glued together
with a space left unglued for this purpose. The
covering material is put on after the book is in boards
and the book is made tight backed. This is probably
the strongest method of attaching a book to the
boards. In fact it is stronger than is necessary for
any except very heavy books which receive hard wear.
(Fig. 12.)</p>


<h3>TIGHT AND LOOSE BACKS</h3>

<p>For years there has been a certain mild controversy
regarding the relative merits of tight and loose
backs for leather bound books. Tight backs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
those in which the material used for covering the
book is pasted or glued to the back. Loose backs are
those which, by means of folded paper or a piece of
paper put in as described on page 37, are prevented
from adhering to the back. When the book is opened
the back springs out. (Fig. 13.)</p>

<p>The tight back book always forms a hinge at the
place where the book is opened. Since the place of
the hinge is constantly changing the back of the book
after much use becomes concave instead of convex,
and the appearance of the book is seriously marred.
Also the constant creasing of the back tends to erase
the gold lettering, so that it becomes indistinct. If
labels are put on they speedily come off. It is customary
to use tight backs on very heavy books,
though there are cases where such books have been
put in loose backs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" width="350" height="230" alt="Figure 13.&mdash;Tight back and loose back." title="">
<span class="caption">Figure 13.&mdash;Tight back and loose back.</span>
</div>

<p>The loose-back book always preserves its shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and good appearance, even when the paper on the
inside may be so badly worn that the book should be
withdrawn. The strain, however, always comes at
the joint; therefore if poor leather is used it will
quickly wear out at this point.</p>

<p>Each method has its advocates, but so far as the
present writer can learn, there seems to be little
to choose from the standpoint of strength. It
might seem that the tight-back book would be the
stronger, but as a matter of fact in actual wear loose-back
books seem to hold their own with the others.
In fact when the soft, spongy papers are used the
loose backs are obviously stronger. It seems clear
that there is little choice one way or the other, and
the question must be decided by the personal preference
of the librarian.</p>


<p>JOINTS</p>

<p>In library binding French joints are now used in
place of regular joints. Figure 14 shows plainly the
difference between the two. In the regular joint it
will be noticed that when the book is opened there is
a sharp crease in one line from head to tail. In the
French joint the strain is distributed over a much
greater area. In regular joints the leather is sometimes
pared at the joints to permit of easier opening
of the book. In French joints the full thickness of
the leather can be used. French joints are made by
setting the boards away from the back about one-eighth
of an inch. When the cover is put on it is
necessary to crease between the board and the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
while the leather is still damp.</p>

<p>An excellent illustration showing the anatomy of
a joint may be found on page 51 of Dana's "Notes on
bookbinding for libraries," ed. 2.</p>

</div>


<h3>CORNERS</h3>

<p>Corners on library books should be rounded to
prevent the board from breaking if the book falls and
to prevent the cloth from wearing through at this
point. Rounded corners are peculiar to library binding.
As a rule they are not made by cutting off a
corner of the board, but by turning in the cloth diagonally
from the corner and then from the side and
end. Sometimes both methods are adopted. If government
specification cloth is used it is probable that
"library corners" will not be necessary.</p>

<p>In some libraries pieces of leather or vellum are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
put on corners. Leather is put on in order to raise
the bottom of the boards from the shelf, while vellum
is used to make the corners hard and prevent them
from breaking or showing signs of wear. While
both serve the purpose for which they are intended,
the process of putting them on adds materially to the
expense, and in most cases this is not warranted by
the increased use of the book.</p>


<h3>TRIMMING</h3>

<p>Binders should be instructed to trim as little as
possible. This is important for all books, but most
of all for periodicals. In fiction and juvenile books it
is important to have wide margins, because the text
will remain legible for a longer period of time if protected
by a margin from the contact of hands. Non-fiction
books which are likely to remain in use for a
longer period of years may need to be rebound and
trimmed again. Therefore wide margins are essential
to good wear as well as to good appearance.</p>

<p>It is customary to bind front covers of periodicals.
Sometimes it is desirable to bind advertising pages,
and it is necessary to do so when the publishers follow
the pernicious practice of continuing regular
articles on advertising pages. Covers and advertising
pages are generally printed with much narrower
margins than the body of the magazine and unless
great care is taken in trimming parts of the printed
matter will be cut off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<h3>HEADBANDS</h3>

<p>Cotton headbands can be added during the forwarding
but inasmuch as they are simply pasted on
they add nothing to the strength and very little to the
beauty of the book. When silk headbands are carefully
sewed on they add both strength and beauty.
An excellent description of the process of putting on
headbands will be found in Cockerell's "Binding and
the care of books," page 147.</p>


<h3>HOW TO RECOGNIZE A WELL BOUND BOOK</h3>

<p>The ability to recognize a well bound book is
necessary when comparing the work of different
binders. A book should be bound in material suitable
for the use which the book is to receive and in such
a way as to give the maximum amount of service. It
should also be as attractive in appearance as is compatible
with these two requirements. In deciding
whether a book is suitably bound for library use the
following points should be kept in mind:</p>

<p>1. A volume must show evidence of neat and
careful workmanship.</p>

<p>2. If the book is to be used constantly leather is
essential; if occasionally only, leather is an element
of weakness.</p>

<p>3. All books that receive hard usage should have
end papers and fly-leaves guarded with cloth. If
sewed regularly the first and last signatures also
should be guarded.</p>

<p>4. Saw cuts should not be deep.</p>

<p>5. The book should be flexible and stay flat
wherever opened. (This is not always possible in the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
case of overcast books or books printed on stiff, brittle
paper.)</p>

<p>6. When the book is lying flat the top should
remain flat. When standing on end the sections
should not separate slightly at the back.</p>

<p>7. The book should feel firm and compact to the
hand.</p>

<p>8. When opened the volume should not make a
crackling noise due to too much glue on the back.</p>

<p>9. The book should have a well rounded back
and the cover should fit well at the joint. Flat backs
are not desirable.</p>

<p>10. Margins should be wide and cut straight.
Periodicals should not be trimmed so that printing on
covers or advertisements is cut off.</p>

<p>11. The book should have French joints.</p>

<p>12. The cover should not separate easily from
the book when pressure is applied.</p>

<p>13. Lettering on the back should be legible and
put on straight.</p>

<p>14. On opening the book sections at the back
should be perfectly smooth, showing that they have
not been crushed in backing.</p>

<p>15. Guards for plates, maps, sections, etc., should
be so applied as to leave the paper unwrinkled.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MATERIALS</h3>


<p>In a recent pamphlet issued by the Government
Printing Office, containing a list of materials and
articles used in the printing and binding of public
documents, the number of items for binding alone
reaches the surprising total of 171. Many of these
are materials used in marbling, others indicate slight
variations of color and weight in standard leathers
and cloths. But exclusive of all these the number
of materials called for is over forty.</p>

<p>It is not the writer's purpose to discuss all of these
forty or more materials, but it seems necessary to
mention that many materials other than those used
in covering books (always some kind of cloth or
leather) are used in binding. Furthermore, the
strength of the book after it is bound will depend
almost as much upon the materials used in its inner
construction as upon those used in covering it. The
inner materials, if not wisely selected as to quality
or in reference to the kind of service which the book
is to receive, may cause an otherwise excellently
bound book to give poor service.</p>

<p>In general, however, a reference to binding materials
means those which are used in covering books.
It is the cover which renders a book attractive or
unattractive, and which contributes more than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
other one item, except possibly sewing, to the long
life of the book. We should therefore know the initial
cost of different covering materials and the length
of service which each material will give under different
conditions. When they are not imitations we
should be able to recognize the best-known materials,
either on or off the books. An unscrupulous binder
can easily take advantage of ignorance of these
matters.</p>

<p>So far as the librarian is concerned only two
classes of materials need be considered for the
covers of books&mdash;leathers and book cloths. This does
not indicate a restriction of choice, for when we consider
that leather comes from a large number of
animals, that there are a great many different kinds
of cloth, that cloths and leathers can be obtained in
a great variety of colors, there seems to be an
embarrassment of riches. As a matter of fact most
librarians confine themselves to four kinds of leather
and four or five kinds of cloth, each in three or four
different shades.</p>


<h3>LEATHER</h3>

<p>The most expensive materials used in covering
books and those which vary most in quality are
leathers, the skins of animals which have been tanned
and made flexible. The best bookbinding leathers are
those which are flexible both in the skin and on books,
and the surface of which is not easily damaged by
friction. Owing to the many kinds of leathers and
their variation in quality, it is difficult to learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
know them well.</p>

<p>The skins of all sorts of animals have been used
for covering books. Certain ones, not suitable for
library binding, are still used for the purpose in
various parts of the country, so that librarians need
to become expert in their knowledge of which leathers
may be employed and which ought to be rejected.</p>

<p>Variations in the same kinds of leathers are
caused by:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Age.</i> Skins of animals which have not
reached full growth should not be used for binding
library books. Since they are immature, the fibres
have not become tough, and they have not reached
their maximum thickness. If the skins which the
binder is using are exceptionally small, it is probable
that the animals from which they were obtained were
too young. On the other hand, the skins of very old
animals should not be used, since the fibres of the
skins have lost something of their flexibility and
strength. They cannot be readily detected, but they
are sure to give poor service. As an illustration of
the effect which age has upon leather it will be
sufficient to note the well-known fact that calf skin
is useless for library purposes, while cowhide within
certain well-defined limits is exceedingly useful.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The sex of the animal.</i> It has been proved
beyond question that the skin from the female of
some animals, notably goats, does not wear as well
as that from the male.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Country from which they come.</i> It is an
interesting fact that the skin of a sheep which comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
from Persia is not the same kind of a skin as that
of a sheep which is raised in the United States. In
general, it may be said that skins from animals
inhabiting warm countries are more likely to be serviceable
than those from the same kind of animals
inhabiting cold countries. In the cold countries more
of the strength goes into the fur or hair which protects
it, while in warm countries a greater amount of
strength goes into the skin itself.</p>

<p>In addition to variations due to these causes there
is likely to be a certain amount of variation in different
parts of the same skin. That part of the skin
which comes from the back of the animal is tougher
than that which comes from the abdomen. The
difference is very noticeable in the skins of some
animals, less so in others.</p>

<p><i>Decay of Leather.</i> Of late years there has been
much dissatisfaction expressed over the decay of
modern leathers. In many cases leathers 100 years
old or more are in a fair state of preservation, while
many leathers&mdash;perhaps we should say most leathers&mdash;30,
20 or even 10 years old, show signs of decay,
and some have rotted away almost entirely. In no
way is the decay of modern leathers shown more
conclusively than in a long file of the sheep-bound
set of the United States Public Documents. The
earlier volumes, covering the 15th Congress up to
the 36th, will in general be found to be in a good
state of preservation. About the year 1860, however,
marked deterioration appears. In some cases it
seems as if the backs had entirely disintegrated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
While a sheep-bound set is the best example of the
decay of modern leathers, many libraries have been
greatly annoyed by the decay of other leathers which
are supposed to be much stronger than sheepskin.</p>

<p>So great was the dissatisfaction with modern
leathers that in the year 1900 the Society of Arts in
London appointed a committee to investigate modern
leathers and to ascertain the best methods for preparing
leathers for binding. The report of this committee
was published in 1905, and a general knowledge
of its contents is necessary for those who wish
to know why leathers decay and how they may be
preserved. Another valuable work which should be
carefully studied is entitled "Leathers for libraries,"
published by the Sound Leather Committee of the
Library Association in England. In a chapter of this
book J. Gordon Parker, Ph. D., Director of the London
Leather Industries Research Laboratories, tells
us that the chief causes of decay are as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The introduction of tanning materials other than oak
and sumac, stronger in tannin, and more rapid in their action.
Many of these tanning materials are unstable, and the leather
produced disintegrates on exposure to light and air.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tanning is the process of changing hides, which
are animal matter subject to decay, into material
which is strong and flexible and which is not subject
to decay. There are two groups of tanning materials.
The one called the pyrogallol group, which includes
sumac, gall nuts and oak bark, is commended by the
Committee of the Society of Arts. The other is
called the catechol group and is strongly condemned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Among the materials belonging to the catechol group
are hemlock bark and larch, used chiefly in this
country, and turwar bark used largely in tanning
East Indian goat and sheep skins.</p>

<p>The United States Government Printing Office
proposals call for leathers tanned with a pyrogallol
tannin, since it has been proved that such leathers
prove most resistant to the evil effects of light, heat
and gas. If a skin has been tanned with sumac, or
sumac in combination with oak bark, it has received
the best possible preparation for its life as a bookbinding
leather.</p>

<p>It is not possible, neither is it necessary, to have
all leathers tanned with sumac. Those leathers which
are intended to remain on the shelves for many decades,
should be in this tannage. Those which will
be discarded in a few years may be tanned in a less
expensive manner. Even some of the quick, modern
materials, which accomplish in a few hours what
once would have taken weeks, are not too poor for
leathers which are not to be kept indefinitely.</p>

<p>Even the expert cannot detect skins which have
not been tanned and dyed properly, but leathers which
last a short time may be suspected either of being
improperly tanned or of having some kind of injurious
acid in their composition.</p>
<blockquote><p>2. The use of dried and cured skins of variable soundness
imported from abroad. Goat, calf and sheep skins are
imported into this country (England) from all over the
world; some are simply dried in the sun, some salted, whilst
others are cured with various ingredients.</p>

<p>3. The use of infusions of acids and other bleaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
agents to produce bright and even shades of colour.</p></blockquote>

<p>Skins tanned with sumac are light-colored and
can be dyed any desired color. Most other tanning
materials, however, make darker-colored skins, which
can be dyed only with dark colors. It has been
found possible to scour and bleach skins with sulphuric
acid and to re-tan with sumac.</p>

<blockquote><p>4. The use of sulphuric or other mineral acids for the
purpose of developing the depth of colour during the process
of dyeing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sulphuric acid is the cause of decay of over 90%
of modern bookbinding leathers. Having once been
used, it cannot be wholly removed without the use
of other chemicals.</p>

<blockquote><p>5. The shaving and splitting of skins for producing an
even substance.</p></blockquote>

<p>In splitting and shaving, the long, strongest fibres
of the skin are torn or cut off, and the part which
remains for binding purposes is the weakest part of
the skin.</p>

<blockquote><p>6. Printing and embossing grains upon leather, together
with other methods of finishing now in common use.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are various ways of bringing out the natural
grain of leathers which are perfectly legitimate
and which do no harm. The danger in graining
comes when the grain is embossed by means of a
plate, which is heated and pressed on the skin. No
good leather should ever be embossed.</p>

<blockquote><p>7. The stripping, scouring, souring and re-tanning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
East India leathers (Persians).</p></blockquote>

<p>Some imported skins are only partially tanned,
and it is necessary to wash out the tannin with some
kind of alkali, which also takes out much of the
natural grease of the skin. They are then treated
with sulphuric acid and re-tanned. They are always
poor and are seldom sold as re-tanned skins.</p>

<blockquote><p>8. The removal of the natural grease or nourishment of
the skin.</p></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing eight causes of decay are beyond
our direct control. The leathers are manufactured
and put on the market, and the binder has to use such
as he is able to obtain. No matter how much the
librarian may insist upon leathers free-from-acid, he
is helpless if the binder cannot obtain them. All that
he can do is to insist that leathers without acid must
be used, if obtainable.</p>

<p>Although these causes of decay are beyond the
librarian's control, there are several causes of decay
quite within his power to avoid. They are the following,
due to improper methods used in binding,
or to physical conditions after the book is on the
shelf:</p>

<p>1. Direct sunlight.</p>

<p>2. Gas fumes. This evil is hard to guard against
if there are gas pipes in the building. There is sure
to be more or less leakage, and even a small amount
of gas in the air has a bad effect upon leather.</p>

<p>3. Tobacco smoke. This is not likely to be very
detrimental in libraries, since the rules generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
forbid smoking.</p>

<p>4. Excessive dampness, which encourages mildew.</p>

<p>5. Extreme dry heat. A temperature much in
excess of 70 Fahrenheit is likely to dry up the oil
which gives flexibility to leather.</p>

<p>6. Undue wetting or stretching the leather in
covering. Some binders soak the leathers and stretch
them in placing them on the books. When the leathers
dry they shrink, the fibres are strained and the
life of the leather shortened.</p>

<p>7. Use of poor paste in binding. This frequently
sets up a fermentation that is very harmful to
leathers.</p>

<p>8. Dust, especially in conjunction with dampness,
is very injurious to leather.</p>

<p>Doubtless there are other things which have a
deleterious effect upon leathers in libraries; but if a
library is well ventilated, if leather-covered books are
not kept in cellars or basements that are very damp,
or where direct sunlight can fall upon them, and if
the binder uses good paste and proper care in covering
the books, we may reasonably place the responsibility
of undue decay of leathers upon the manufacturers.</p>

<p>The various reports quoted so far have dealt
with qualities of leathers due to tanning, manufacture,
method of binding and time in use. Natural
or mechanical qualities of leathers have not been
touched upon. Those who are interested in this phase
of the question should read the report of Mr. Cedric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Chivers on "The relative value of leathers and other
binding materials," made at the meeting of the American
Library Association at Pasadena in 1911. Mr.
Chivers employed Mr. Alfred Seymour Jones, in
England, to make tests which would show the
tearing and breaking strain of various leathers.
These natural qualities of leathers are obviously important,
but too much stress must not be laid upon
them. It is possible that a leather naturally strong
and tough when new would rapidly deteriorate with
age. The records as presented in Mr. Chivers' report
must be taken in conjunction with facts determined by
the investigation of the Society of Arts. In the main,
however, it will be found that leathers which best
stood the tests of the Society of Arts also showed the
greatest resistance to the tearing and breaking strains
made by Mr. Chivers.</p>

<p><i>Preservation of Leather.</i> Various attempts have
been made both by librarians and others to discover
some substance which would preserve leather effectually
after the book is bound. Some of these attempts
have been temporarily successful, but time
alone will tell whether leathers are permanently
preserved by the treatments used, or whether applications
of the preservative must be frequently made.
Owing to the fact that in law libraries practically all
the books published previous to 1900 were bound in
sheepskin, the lasting qualities of leathers is a question
that affects law libraries more than any other.
Dr. Wire, of the Worcester (Mass.) County Law
Library, who has made a careful study of the
problem, advises the use of vaseline or some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
similar by-product of petroleum well rubbed into the
leather with the bare hand and allowed to dry in the
air until the leather has absorbed it. Better results
were obtained by allowing the volumes to dry in the
summer by natural heat instead of artificial heat in
the winter. For some books Dr. Wire makes use of
a bookbinder's varnish after the softening product
has thoroughly penetrated the leather. A full description
of the processes may be obtained from Dr. Wire's
pamphlet, "Leather preservation," published in 1911.</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages of Dr. Wire's method
are:</p>

<p>1. The necessity of rubbing in the preservative
from three to five times, according to the condition of
the leather at the time of first treatment.</p>

<p>2. The care necessary to prevent the material
used from smearing tables, trucks, floor, shelves and
clothing at time of application; also when books are
back on the shelves the care required to keep from
rubbing against them and the necessity of wiping
them off when they are handed to readers.</p>

<p>3. The tendency of books to swell at the back
when first treated in this way, demanding extra care
lest, in an effort to pull out one book, a whole shelf-full
fall to the floor.</p>

<p>4. The repetition of the process after ten years.</p>

<p>It is possible that these drawbacks will be sufficient
to dissuade all except the most stout-hearted from
using this method of preserving leather. Rebinding
in cloth seems to be much more simple and, on the
whole, not much more expensive.</p>

<p>The question of a preservative is discussed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the Report of the Society of Arts, from which the
following quotation is taken:</p>

<blockquote><p>Enquiries have frequently been made as to the use of
preservative pastes upon old bindings. It has been mentioned
that the seasonings of white of egg or blood albumen usually
employed in finishing leather have some preservative effect,
and no harm can arise from the application of very thin
coatings of white of egg. The use of ammonia to thin or
preserve the solution must be avoided, but the whites, after
thorough beating, may be rendered antiseptic by the addition
of a small quantity of camphor, thymol, or some essential oil.
Vaseline has been employed as a dressing, and, if otherwise
suitable, will no doubt have a preservative effect upon the
leather. A very moderate use of the wax, soap, and turpentine
preparations made as shoe pastes, is also likely to be
beneficial, and no doubt a special preparation might be made
on these lines which would be still more suitable. Paraffin wax
dissolved in benzine is also harmless, and the surface to
which it has been applied takes a good polish with a flannel
after drying. Professor Proctor has experimented with a
finish introduced by the Berlin Aniline Company some years
ago for coloured leathers, with apparently satisfactory results.
The preparation is practically a very hard stearine soap with
excess of stearic acid, and is made by boiling 8 parts of
stearic acid with 1 part of caustic soda and 50 parts of water
until thoroughly dissolved, and then adding 150 parts of cold
water and stirring till the material sets to a jelly. It is
applied very thinly with a sponge or rag, and after thorough
drying is polished with a soft brush or flannel. The alkali
present in the soap is useful in neutralising any mineral acids
contained in the leather. In very acid leathers it has been
noticed that the sodium sulphate so formed will sometimes
appear upon the surface as a white film, but this is easily
removed with a damp cloth, and the surface, after drying,
repolished with flannel.</p></blockquote>

<p>Old books which it is desirable to preserve as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
long as possible in their original bindings and books
which will be used very little may be treated with
some form of preservative. If the book is to be
much used, it would better be rebound. Dr. Wire's
experiments have been carried on exclusively with
law books. Whether the same processes could be
used on books bound in morocco or pigskin is something
that has not yet been determined. Most
leather-bound books break first at the joint. The
sheep bindings in a law library would show signs
of disintegration long before the leather reached the
breaking point, whereas the librarian would first
notice that morocco was decaying when the leather
actually cracked. Once cracked, no amount of preservative
would do any good.</p>


<h3>KINDS OF LEATHER<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>

<p>The leathers that have been used in binding books
have come from all sorts of animals, but so far as
the librarian is concerned the skins of four animals
only need be taken into consideration&mdash;the sheep, the
cow, the pig and the goat. In England some experiments
have been made with sealskin, but it has not
been used long enough to give any definite idea of its
resistance to the encroachments of time.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The prices of leathers given in the text are those which prevailed
during the summer of 1915.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheepskin</span></p>

<p>Sheepskin is a soft, flexible leather with weak
fibres, and with a surface easily abraded. It has been
used for bindings practically ever since books were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
put into leathers; and, under the old methods of
tanning and manufacturing, proved satisfactory. In
many libraries it is possible to see leather books bound
in sheep in the 17th century which are in a good
state of preservation. Even the sheep of the beginning
of the 19th century is frequently well preserved.
Since 1860, however, the quality of sheep has greatly
deteriorated. This is bad enough, but unfortunately
sheep likes to masquerade under the name of morocco
and other leathers of a better grade, so that its use
is much more extensive than appears at first sight.
In the process of imitation the grain of the leather
imitated is stamped on the skin. When this is done
it generally takes an expert to detect the fact that
the leather is not what it pretends to be, and even
experts are sometimes deceived after the leather is on
a book.</p>

<p>The strongest sheepskins are made when tanned
with oak bark. Sumac, which is such a valuable
tanning material with other leathers, is here inferior
to oak.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of sheepskin, the wool sheep
which is known to all, and the hair sheep which is not
found in the United States, and which in reality is a
cross between a sheep and a goat. The hair sheep
comes from India, China, South America and Africa,
generally from mountainous districts. It has a much
tougher fibre and is a better wearing skin than that
of the wool sheep. Unfortunately most of these
skins, which are all imported, are made into shoe
leather. When properly tanned they are very suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
for library binding, and their use for that purpose
is increasing.</p>

<p>The wool sheepskin in its natural color has been
used for many years for binding law books. It is
seldom used for anything except government documents
and law books, and for this reason is known
as "law-sheep."</p>

<p><i>Roan.</i> Roans, the term used for sheepskins after
they are dyed, can be used advantageously on books
which will be handled a great deal, and which in any
event will not stay on the shelves indefinitely. Properly
tanned and dyed, they make a satisfactory leather
for a time, but their life under the best of conditions
seldom exceeds ten or twelve years. While this is
true of good roans, it unfortunately remains true that
in the United States, at least, it is difficult to get roans
that are properly tanned and dyed. Therefore, unless
one is sure that the quality of the skin is the best, he
should use no sheep under any conditions.</p>

<p><i>Skiver.</i> Skiver is the outside of a sheepskin
which has been split, the inner side being known as
the flesher. It is a leather much used for commercial
binding, but since the splitting process takes
away a great part of the strength of the skin, leaving
it not much stronger than strong paper, skiver is
wholly unfitted for library use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cowhide</span></p>

<p>Cowhide, sometimes known as American russia,
is a leather which has increased enormously in use in
the last twenty-five years. It is a thick, coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
leather, rather unattractive in appearance, strong when
new, but with age rapidly deteriorating in quality,
even when no deleterious substance has been used in
tanning or dyeing. It is a harder leather to work
than roan, but the quality is much more uniform and
it can be used advantageously for binding fiction and
other books which will be much used. In its natural
state (undyed) it can be used in place of law-sheep
for law books, but has a tendency to become dark.
It can be obtained in many colors. Since it is too
thick a leather to be used in full thickness, practically
all skins are split, and the amount of flesh left with
the grain determines the weight of the leather. A
greater or less amount is taken off according to the
purpose for which the leather is intended. Bookbinding
cowhide costing 20c to 25c. a square foot is
the lightest weight leather that has the right to be
called cow.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The life of cowhide is from five to
twelve years.</p>

<p><i>Buffing.</i> Buffing is practically only the grain of
cowskin from which almost all the flesh has been
split. It is not suitable for library books, since it is
very thin and begins to disintegrate in less than five
years. After it is on the volume it is hard to detect, so
that some library binders have been tempted to use it
instead of cow. But as buffing is never sold as cow,
the library binder has no excuse for keeping it in
stock.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This is the normal price of cow. The European war has had the
disastrous effect of raising the price and lowering the quality. Until
conditions become normal again all cowhide should be shunned.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pigskin</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Pigskin is one of the strongest leathers, having a
hard, resisting surface and a good, tough fibre. In
the grain, the holes which were left when bristles
were removed are plainly visible, giving the leather
a distinctive appearance, which can be imitated successfully,
but which is much less often imitated than
the grain of morocco. If there be doubt of the genuineness
of pig, soak a piece of the leather until it
has absorbed a quantity of water, and then stretch it.
If the grain pulls out, it is imitation; if genuine, the
bristle holes still show plainly. Oak bark tanning is
the best for this leather, and, since it is more nearly
gristle (less fibrous) than other leathers, dyes and
chemicals should not be used which will interfere
with its quality of resisting friction. It should be
used in its natural color whenever possible.</p>

<p>Pigskin frequently comes in skins which are too
thick for the binder to work easily, or which are very
uneven in thickness. In such cases the paring down
of the skin is likely to injure its strength. Because
of its thickness pig is generally supposed to be
more suitable for large than for small books, but
inasmuch as several binders have used it successfully
for years on small books, it may be taken for granted
that it can be used with good results on all books,
large or small, which are to receive hard usage. It
needs constant handling, and the absorption of a
certain amount of oil from the hands to keep it pliable.
Otherwise it dries rapidly and cracks along the joint.
This, however, is true of all leathers to a greater or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
less extent. Pig costs from 40c. to 45c. a square foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goat</span></p>

<p>The leather which makes the strongest and most
attractive binding comes from the skins of goats and
is called morocco, because it originally came from that
country. In the course of time goat skins from other
countries were tanned with sumac (originally a distinguishing
characteristic of a genuine morocco), but
the same name was applied so that we now have the
paradoxical terms, Turkey morocco, Levant morocco,
etc. Moroccos have a beautiful grain, are flexible,
soft and pliable to the hand, and resist hard wear;
qualities which contribute to their great popularity.</p>

<p>Morocco varies greatly in quality as well as in
appearance. Unfortunately the skins which are best
in quality, considering the length of time they will
wear, are not always those best in appearance. The
skins of goats with long hair from the colder countries
make beautiful bindings; but the skins of goats
from the hot countries, such as the interior of Africa,
having short hair, while not so attractive in appearance,
are tougher and wear longer. In addition to
the many grades of genuine morocco there are as
many more imitations of it made from sheepskin, cowhide,
etc. Only the expert can detect some of them in
the skin, and even he may be deceived when the
leather is on the back of the book.</p>

<p>In general it should be said that genuine morocco
is the most expensive leather that a library can use,
and that it can be used to the greatest advantage only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
occasionally. It makes an excellent binding for large
reference books which are constantly handled, for art
books which must be attractively bound, and for some
periodicals which are much used in reference work.
It is not used nearly so much in libraries to-day as it
was ten or fifteen years ago, and it is quite safe to
say that it will be used less ten years from to-day
than it is now.</p>

<p><i>Levant morocco</i>, made from the skins of Angora
goats, is the most expensive and most beautiful
leather used in binding. It has a large, prominent
grain, but is far too expensive for any library to use,
especially when it must be conceded that in its wearing
quality it does not equal that of some less expensive
moroccos. Mr. Chivers' test showed that so
far as tensile strength goes, this leather is very much
weaker than many leathers much less expensive.
When the skin has been subjected to pressure until
the surface is smooth it is known as "crushed levant."</p>

<p><i>Turkey morocco</i>, made of skins of goats from
Turkey, is a very strong, durable leather which all
libraries will find occasion to use from time to time.
It is very easily imitated. Under exposure to atmospheric
conditions existing in many libraries its life
may not extend beyond thirty years. In one library at
least, where conditions of light and heat were poor,
the best Turkey morocco that the market afforded
showed signs of disintegration within twelve years.
Good Turkey morocco can be obtained for 35c. a
square foot.</p>

<p><i>Persian morocco</i>, which comes from the skin of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Persian sheep (not goat), is not particularly attractive
in appearance and is very poor in quality. It is
used extensively for commercial work, but is absolutely
valueless for library binding.</p>

<p><i>Niger morocco</i> is a goat skin which comes from
the interior of Africa, generally by way of Tripoli,
and is by no means a recent discovery, though we
knew little about it five years ago. It is tanned by
natives according to some method of vegetable tanning
not completely known at this time. While in
appearance it is not so attractive as some other moroccos,
because of blemishes due to carelessness in
handling and to the imperfect removal of some of
the hairs, it has been proved by the tests made under
the direction of Mr. Chivers to be stronger than all
other moroccos; the inference is that it is more durable.
Until recently it has been very hard to obtain
in the United States.</p>

<p><i>Bock morocco</i> is not a morocco but a split Persian
sheep so poor in quality that it is mentioned only to
be condemned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calfskin</span></p>

<p>Calfskin in all its various characters, such as divinity,
kip, marbled, mottled, smooth, tree, or just
plain calf is a very beautiful leather much used in the
past for binding books for individuals. For this purpose
it has, of late years, been crowded out by
Levant morocco. It has a soft, smooth surface which
disintegrates rapidly under the action of heat and gas
and has little strength even for temporary use. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the library it is useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Russia Leather</span></p>

<p>This is a brownish-red leather made from the
skins of different animals, tanned with willow bark
and filled with a preparation of birch oil which gives
it its peculiar odor. Neither in its genuine form nor
in imitation is it a useful leather for libraries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sealskin</span></p>

<p>Although experiments have been made with it in
some English libraries sealskin has never been much
used in the United States for library binding. It is
made from the skins of the hair seal, the supply coming
from all parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.
According to Mr. Douglas Cockerell and other binding
experts in England, the skin is peculiarly suited
for library use. It is reported to be a hard-wearing
leather, tough and pliable, even in quality so that no
part of the skin must be discarded because too thin
or too weak, and possessing a beautiful grain. The
price ranges from a point somewhat higher than that
of the poorer moroccos to one somewhat lower than
the higher prices. Unfortunately it can be easily
imitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vellum</span></p>

<p>Probably no discussion of leather is complete
without mentioning vellum, a binding material which
does not resemble leather, but which nevertheless is
made from calfskin or sometimes from goat skin. It
is prepared by the use of lime, and as far as the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
wear on flat surface is concerned, is perhaps better
than any leather. It is, however, very susceptible to
moisture, which makes it warp; and to light, which
makes it hard and brittle. Since it is very hard, does
not bend easily and is hard to work, its chief use is
on the corners of books to protect them and make
them less likely to break or rub. Large libraries have
used it somewhat for this purpose, but the use is dying
out.</p>

<p>In making a study of leathers it is well to obtain
samples of all kinds, including those which are unsuitable
for library use, and to examine them carefully,
noting the appearance of the grain, thickness
of skin, flexibility, and softness of surface. Perhaps
more money can be wasted through ignorance of the
comparative values of different kinds of leather
which it is permissible to use in library binding, than
in mismanagement of any other part of binding.</p>


<h3>CLOTH</h3>

<p>Cloth is fully as important as leather in the economy
of binding. Several years ago it was the custom
to bind periodicals and other books which were used
comparatively seldom in leather, while fiction, juvenile
and other books which wore out quickly were
bound in cloth. Recently the opposite course has
been more favored. Books which receive unusually
hard usage and are in the hands of readers constantly
are bound in leather; while those which are
used seldom, including periodicals, are bound in some
kind of cloth. Without doubt the change is a wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
one. Even the best of leather disintegrates in time
under the action of heat, gas, light, etc., and to-day
many a volume bound in leather ten or fifteen years
ago has parted from its sides, necessitating rebinding
or recovering. Had it been bound in a good quality
of cloth it would to-day be in good condition, and
probably would remain in good condition for a hundred
years. It requires considerable courage to
change the binding of a good set of a standard periodical,
such as the Atlantic or Harper's, from an
attractive half morocco binding to an unattractive
buckram. Unquestionably, if economy is an object,
the change should be made, except possibly in the
case of a library which uses these periodicals daily.
Every librarian must decide each case for himself
strictly according to the use the set is to receive,
always bearing in mind the fact that leather disintegrates
with time, whereas cloth does not unless
exposed to excessive moisture.</p>

<p>No cloth which is suitable for library use is perfectly
satisfactory because it has not the strength of
good leather, cannot be used advantageously on very
heavy books, soils easily and with use grows soft and
flabby, especially along the joints. But on the other
hand even those not suitable for libraries which are
used by the publisher on cheap books are much better
than poor grades of leathers, such as skiver, bock,
buffing, etc.</p>

<p>The requisite qualities of a good cloth are:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Endurance when folded back and forth in
the same place, so that it may withstand the wear at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the joint caused by opening the book.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Smoothness, so that there will be a comparatively
small amount of friction when withdrawing a
book from between two others on the shelf.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Ability to withstand constant rubbing back
and forth on tables.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Color that is fast when exposed to light; if
possible it should be fast to water also, though this
is less important.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Color should be dyed in the piece, not
pressed in by machinery.</p>

<p>Many cloths have some of these qualities but few
have all of them. So far as is known to the writer
only the grade of cloth described on page 77 has the
last qualification.</p>

<p>Practically all cloth used in the United States is
made of cotton. The best cloths are manufactured by
The Holliston Mills, Norwood, Mass.; The Interlaken
Mills, New York City; The Joseph Bancroft &amp;
Sons Company, Wilmington, Del., and by the Winterbottom
Company and the Manchester Book Cloth
Company in England. Since a number of grades are
made in several different patterns and a great number
of shades for each grade and each pattern, a
variety of choice is permitted. As a matter of
fact, however, most librarians select a good grade
with a regular weave and confine themselves to a few
standard shades, such as dark green, brown, red, dark
blue, and tan.</p>

<p>Since the strength of the warp is much greater
than that of the weft, it is advisable when possible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
cover books with the warp running across the cover.
This, however, may entail some hardship on the
binder for it may frequently happen that in order to
cut his cover economically he must make the warp
run lengthwise of the book. If a strong cloth is used
the advantage is not great enough to be insisted upon.</p>

<p>Each of the American firms mentioned makes
three distinct grades, all of which libraries may use.
Each firm uses a different name for each grade. In
other words, there are no general names which can
be used for the corresponding grade in all makes.
Therefore for the purposes of this chapter these
cloths will be considered under the heads of Grades
1, 2 and 3, but it must be remembered that this is an
arbitrary designation not known to the trade. Under
each grade will be given the specific names used by
the three manufacturers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grade 1</span><a name="Grade_1" id="Grade_1"></a></p>

<p>Grade one of cloth, the cheapest that a librarian
may use, is not made of the best quality of cotton
thread and should never be used under any circumstances
for full binding. It may be used on the sides
of books bound in leather; if this be done the corners
should be covered with vellum, for this cloth does not
withstand hard usage and is likely to fray at the corners.
It is a cloth commonly used by publishers, but
should be used sparingly by the librarian. "Art vellum"
made by the Interlaken Mills, "Aldine vellum"
made by the Holliston Mills, and "Linen finish" made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by the Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Company, come within
this grade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grade 2</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Grade two is made of a better grade of
cotton and with a closer weave than the preceding,
but is not sufficiently strong to be used for full binding.
It can be used more satisfactorily than the preceding
on the sides of books bound in leather or duck.
In common with all cloths, except the buckram made
according to the government specifications (which
will be discussed later), the different colors are not
made, as one might suppose, by dyeing the cloth after
it is woven, but by mixing the color with the sizing
or starch which is used in finishing the cloth, and
pressing it into the cloth by machinery. As a natural
result the color rubs off with wear and the natural
gray of the original cloth as first woven appears.
"Art canvas" made by the Interlaken Mills, "Classic
buckram" made by the Holliston Mills, and "Polished
buckram," by the Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Company
come within this grade.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Buckram.</i> Under the name of buckram
various grades of cloth are manufactured which
resemble to a greater or less degree those mentioned
under Grade 2 (<i>a</i>). Generally it is a coarsely woven
cloth stiffened with glue or sizing, and the term originally
indicated that the cloth was made of linen. At
the present time linen buckram made in England can
be obtained, but all that is manufactured in the United
States is made of cotton. Linen buckram costs much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
more than cotton and it is doubtful if it is any more
serviceable. All of the three manufacturers mentioned
make buckrams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grade 3</span></p>

<p>Prior to 1907 the Congressional set of government
documents distributed to the depository libraries
had been bound in sheepskin and the leather on
the volumes had disintegrated so much as to make the
set a hard one to care for. In 1907 the Congressional
Printing Investigation Commission asked librarians
of depository libraries to suggest, without considering
cost, suitable binding materials for Government Documents.
The number of replies received was 124,
embodying suggestions as follows: full sheep, 11;
half-russia, 78; cloth, 25; buckram, 70; linen duck,
20; canvas, 19. Some librarians expressed more than
one preference, so that the total number of preferences
was greater than the total of those replying.
Most of those who favored sheep did so because of
their desire for uniformity. Those who favored half-russia
undoubtedly desired half American russia, or
cowhide. 134 expressed preference for some form of
cloth.</p>

<p>After receiving the replies from librarians the
Printing Investigation Commission obtained samples
of cloth from various cloth manufacturers in the
United States and the Bureau of Standards made a
series of chemical and physical tests to determine the
durability of these cloths. Chemical tests were made
to discover whether the colors were fast when exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to light. It is to be regretted perhaps that no
tests were made to determine whether the cloths were
fast to water and that this qualification was not included
in the final specifications. Admitting, however,
that a cloth which is fast to sun and water both
is a valuable cloth for bookbinding, it is evident that
the quality of fastness to water is not a vitally important
one for cloth used in the United States. The
total number of books injured by water is so small as
to make insistence upon this quality entirely unnecessary.
If books become so soiled that they need to be
washed they should be bound in waterproof cloth.</p>

<p>Because many volumes of Government Documents
are sent to Porto Rico and the Philippines where insects
eat almost anything of an animal or vegetable
character, the desirability of the cloth as an article of
diet for insects, was also tested.</p>

<p>The physical tests indicated:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Number of threads per inch of warp and weft.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Absorption of moisture.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Weight per yard.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Tensile strength.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Amount of stretch.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Amount of friction developed by rubbing two pieces of cloth together.</p>

<p>This test was made because the friction developed
in taking a book from between two others is an important
matter when a shelf is full of books. If the
friction is great the wear on the back of the book is
correspondingly excessive.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Endurance when folded back and forth in the same place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p><i>h.</i> Endurance under extraordinary conditions of rubbing.</p>

<p>Some of these qualities, such as tensile strength,
amount of stretch, etc., were comparatively unimportant,
but the tests for all were severe and contributed
much to our knowledge of the qualities which should
enter into the composition of durable book cloths.</p>

<p>After a very careful consideration of the results
of the tests and a thorough examination of the
samples submitted, a committee of librarians and
government officials unanimously chose three samples
as the best of all those submitted by the manufacturers.
Of these three samples the cloth numbered 666
was considered the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>Although these three samples were excellent, they
all had one defect&mdash;the color was pressed in by
machinery, not dyed in the piece. After various experiments
had been made by the manufacturers this
defect was remedied. The Government Printing
Office then advertised for bids on cloths which would
meet the Specifications drawn up by the Bureau of
Standards (See Appendix A). Since that time all
the Government documents which continue the old
sheep-bound set have been sent to depository libraries
bound in cloth made according to these specifications.</p>

<p>This cloth is known sometimes as Government
Specification Cloth, but is manufactured under the
specific name of "Library buckram" by the Holliston
Mills, "Art buckram" by the Interlaken Mills, and
"Legal buckram" by the Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Company. The first two are made in pieces about
40 yards long and 38 inches wide, the Bancroft cloth
in pieces 43 yards long and 43 inches wide. It must
be admitted that this cloth is not quite so attractive
in appearance as some of the old cloths which are
not so durable. Some binders claim that it is hard
to use. On the whole, however, it supplies a long
felt want and is the strongest cloth made that is at all
attractive in appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duck</span></p>

<p>Duck or canvas, a rough, heavy cloth much the
same in quality as sail cloth, is the strongest cloth
used in binding, but has some very decided drawbacks
which militate against its use, except when the question
of strength overshadows all others. It always
makes an unattractive-looking volume&mdash;some of the
more fastidious librarians rebel against its use; and
it readily absorbs dirt and moisture, making it disagreeable
to handle if the book has been much used.
Duck having a double twisted thread in the weft is
much more compact and absorbs dirt and moisture
much less rapidly than other kinds. It should be
used on the backs (never for full binding) of newspapers
and such periodicals as are too heavy to put
in library or legal buckram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Imperial Morocco Cloth</span></p>

<p>Imperial morocco cloth, manufactured by the Winterbottom
Book Cloth Company in England, is made
of linen thread and finished with a grain to resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
leather. The kind most used in the United States
resembles a straight-grained morocco. It is an excellent
cloth in appearance, as well as in durability, but
its cost is 50% greater than that of the Government
Specification Cloth. It may be used on semi-popular
books which will not receive a great amount of use,
but which should be as attractive in appearance as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water-Proof Cloths</span></p>

<p>There are several cloths which are waterproof
and therefore easily cleaned when the covers become
soiled. The best of these are durabline, used exclusively
by Cedric Chivers; rexine and pluviusin, used
almost exclusively in England; keratol, made in
Newark, New Jersey; and fabrikoid, made by the
du Pont Powder Company, Wilmington, Delaware.
All of these cloths are said to be acid, alkali and germ
proof, do not absorb grease and can be washed with
soap and water. They are strong, durable cloths, but
they have at first a disagreeable odor, are hard to
work and hard to letter in gold. In the application
of paste to most waterproof cloths, either in the
process of binding or in attaching labels to the back,
it is first necessary to break down the surface of the
cloth or the paste will not hold. This disadvantage
no longer exists in the case of fabrikoid. Keratol and
fabrikoid are made to imitate leather and are frankly
sold as such. Probably the use of these cloths in
libraries will always be comparatively small. Because
they can be easily cleaned they may be used on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
sides of juvenile books, and in rare cases for full
binding.</p>


<h3>GLUE</h3>

<p>No very definite rules can be laid down as to what
kind of glue should be used. The matter must be left
largely in the hands of the binder, who must see that
it is strong, yet flexible; not too poor in quality nor
yet the most expensive kind which is generally used
on furniture. This is too brittle for bookbinding use.</p>

<p>The best glue for bookbinding is made from skins
and shows a dark wine color in the cake. Light
colored glues are made chiefly from bones and are
not usually so good. To prepare glue for use, soak
small pieces in water over night and in the morning
melt in the glue pot. It should never be boiled. A
careful binder will see that utensils are kept clean and
that glue is used in the proper thickness.</p>

<p>Flexible glue, which does not become too hard
either before or after use, is made by mixing glycerine
with good glue. It has no special advantages for use
by binders, but can be used in the library itself for
some of the repairs which assistants may have to make.</p>


<h3>PASTE</h3>

<p>(For paste used in mending, see <a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a>).</p>

<p>The best paste is that made in the ordinary way
with flour and water. The paste should be fresh, for
if it is not a certain fermentation takes place which
is injurious to the book, especially to leather.</p>


<h3>BOARDS</h3><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Not the least important part of the make-up of a
finished book are the boards forming the sides. There
are practically four grades of boards which are known
as strawboards; binders, cloth or millboards; semi-tar,
and tar boards. The cheapest grade is the strawboard,
for which there is no place in library work.</p>

<p>Mill or cloth boards, used for practically all
library work, are generally made from waste papers
of all kinds, though some may have an admixture of
rags. Clay is also mixed with the waste paper pulp
and the whole subjected to heavy pressure in the final
stages of manufacture. They are made in two sizes,
20  30 and 23  29 inches, and are put up in 50-pound
bundles, the number of sheets in the bundle indicating
the thickness of the board. The thickest is a
No. 12 which has 12 sheets in a 50-pound bundle.
They may have as many as 70 sheets in a bundle,
which makes a very thin board. A 20 or 25 board
should be used for fiction and juvenile books and
a 16 or 18 for heavier books such as magazines.
Prices of good cloth boards run from $40 to $50 a
ton.</p>

<p>Semi-tar boards, made from better grade stock
than mill board, should have in their composition a
certain amount of rags and hemp or naval cordage.
They come in the same sizes and weights, costing
about $70 a ton.</p>

<p>Tar boards are the best boards obtainable. Made
of naval cordage, they are very tough and hard to
work. Many of them are allowed to season, in much
the same way as lumber seasons, in order to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
warping. They are much too expensive for library
use, sometimes costing as much as $110 a ton.</p>

<p>The matter of boards is not one about which the
librarian need exercise great watchfulness. Binders
generally use a very good quality, though they sometimes
use too thin a board on a heavy book, such as
a newspaper or large folio. In such cases a board
of suitable thickness can be made by pasting or gluing
two or more together.</p>


<h3>THREAD</h3>

<p>At one time there was no question but that the
best thread to be used in binding was linen. In the
light of present knowledge it may be doubted if this
is true under all circumstances. All commercially
bound books, without exception, are sewed with cotton
thread. Even such large books as the Century
Dictionary, Webster's Dictionary and the United
States Catalog of 1912 are sewed with cotton thread.
Since it was unquestionably the aim of the publishers
of all these books to issue them in the strongest possible
bindings, it is reasonable to suppose that linen
would have been used if it were really the best for
the purpose. The main reason linen thread has been
advised for so long is because its tensile strength is
much greater than that of cotton. On the other hand,
it is just as true that what we may call the fraying
resistance of a cotton thread is greater than that of
linen. Take two threads of the same size, one cotton
and the other linen, make a loop of each thread with
one inside the other, saw back and forth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
cotton will always cut the linen thread. Furthermore,
linen thread deteriorates in quality unless very carefully
stored. The publishers soon discovered these
facts, and since tensile strength is not an important
attribute in a thread that is being used in a book
sewing-machine, they use a cotton thread with thoroughly
satisfactory results.</p>

<p>In the case of library binding, however, the books
are always sewed by hand and the sewer, as she
draws the thread tight, is obliged to use some
strength; for this reason tensile strength is an important
attribute. Hayes' Irish linen thread is generally
specified. The Barbour thread is referred to by Mr.
Dana and by others, but the writer is not familiar
with its use.</p>
<br>
<p>Other materials used in binding are gold leaf,
paper for end papers, tape, headbands, cord and
various concoctions used in finishing the books. Gold
leaf should be 18 to 22 karat, and neither aluminum
nor silver leaf should be used. Paper for end papers
will vary somewhat with the size of the book, but
should never be lighter in weight than a 60-pound
manila. Large libraries may find it desirable to have
an end paper specially made for their own use. Tapes
should be linen and not over three-eighths of an inch
wide. Cord for use in sewing in the regular way
(not overcasting) is a soft twine which can be
obtained from all dealers in bookbinding supplies.
For all books less than twelve inches in height use
four-ply cord; for larger books, five-ply.</p>

<h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3>


<p>After the librarian has definitely decided upon the
binder whom he wishes to employ he must, especially
in dealing with binders who are not accustomed to
library work, draw up specifications as to ways in
which he wishes different classes of books bound. If
he has employed a binder who thoroughly understands
library binding, he may make use of the
binder's knowledge in drawing up the specifications.
Under certain circumstances it may be wise to enter
into a contract with the binder, but ordinarily in the
United States such a course will not be necessary.
After the specifications have been prepared and a
schedule of prices agreed upon, the librarian always
has the right to refuse to pay for books not bound
according to specifications. Therefore, a definite
legal contract is not necessary. The librarian, except
in the case of a few libraries which according to
law must give their work to state officials, is always
at liberty to take his custom from one binder and
give it to another. Thus sufficient pressure is brought
to bear on the binder.</p>

<p>Although the present chapter gives definite specifications
for the binding of various classes of books,
it is always wise to show a certain latitude in the use
of specifications. Local conditions, the papers used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
bookmaking which seem to become poorer and poorer
with each succeeding year, and the kind of a library
which is to use the specifications&mdash;all these must be
taken into consideration when specifications are drawn
up. Moreover, the best specifications will accomplish
little if they are not followed by the binder in a workmanlike
manner, while good workmanship will sometimes
make up for omission of important details in the
specifications.</p>

<p>In the main, it will be found that the following
specifications may be used as a guide, except possibly
in the case of some reference and college libraries
which do not issue books for home use. It has
seemed best to place first general specifications which
apply to all books, followed by additional specifications
for each kind of books treated. The way in
which these specifications are carried out is described
in the chapter on Processes.</p>


<h3>GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS</h3>

<p>1. The binder is responsible for all books consigned
to his care and must replace or pay for all
books lost or injured. When one considers the large
number of volumes passing through a bindery, coming
from many different libraries, the number of
books for which the binder is unable to account is
surprisingly small.</p>

<p>2. The librarian is the judge of whether the
book is bound according to the specifications. Since
he has submitted the specifications and the binder has
agreed to them he should be the sole judge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
result.</p>

<p>3. The binder will be allowed to depart from any
specification if it is desirable in the interests of good
binding. He must, however, prove that he is justified
in so doing.</p>

<p>4. Books must be paid for according to a schedule
of prices agreed upon by the binder and librarian.</p>

<p>5. The size should be determined by measuring
at the back of the volume after it is bound. It might
be wiser, perhaps, to measure the book before the
boards are put on, so that binders would be sure to
trim the book as little as possible. It is the universal
custom, however, to pay according to the measure of
the book with the boards on. This may possibly
tempt the binder to increase the square of the book
just enough to group it with the next larger size so
that he can charge more for it.</p>

<p>6. All items not covered in the schedule of
prices may be charged for at the regular rates of the
binder for such work.</p>

<p>7. All books not oversewed are to be sewed all-along
with Hayes' Irish linen thread, suiting the size
of the thread to the requirements of the book; No. 25
for light, No. 20 for medium and No. 16 for heavy
sections.</p>

<p>8. Cloth must be used for sides of all books
bound in half-leather or half-duck. Never use marbled
paper except occasionally on newspapers.</p>

<p>9. Unless otherwise specified, cloth which conforms
to the specifications of the Bureau of Standards,
or Imperial morocco cloth, must be used for full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
binding. For sides of leather bound books a somewhat
cheaper grade may be used.</p>

<p>10. Duck should have a twisted, double thread
in the weft.</p>

<p>11. Moroccos or pigskins must be guaranteed by
the manufacturer to be free-from-acid.</p>

<p>12. Glue must be best quality of binders' or flexible
glue, and must be used sparingly.</p>

<p>13. Poor materials of any kind must not be used.</p>

<p>14. In taking books apart, all old glue, paste,
back-lining, paper, etc., should be carefully removed.</p>

<p>15. The binder should expect to do a certain
amount of mending of torn pages and guarding of
weak signatures, but should be allowed to charge
extra when the amount is excessive.</p>

<p>16. The text of all books must be collated by
binder and imperfect books returned to the library.
(See under Processes, Collation, <a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>).</p>

<p>17. All illustrations of whatever character printed
on single leaves must be guarded with thin, tough
paper and the guard folded around the adjoining
sections.</p>

<p>Some librarians and binders advocate the use of
cloth guards but this seems hardly necessary. The
cloth guards tend to swell the back of the book, especially
if there be many plates, while the thin, tough
paper is strong enough for ordinary books. Folded
plates should never be sewed through the middle of
the fold, but should be mounted on guards so that the
plates will open out nearly flat when the book is
opened. Folded maps, or other folded plates which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
may be consulted often should, unless otherwise specified,
be guarded with cloth which is as wide as the
book, so that they may be thrown entirely outside the
book and lie flat on a table.</p>

<p>18. Illustrations which are folded more than
once, such as maps, should be carefully cut and
mounted on thin cloth in such a way as to allow for
the folding to come on the cloth alone, not on the
paper.</p>

<p>19. Stitching (that is, sewing signatures lengthwise
with a sewing-machine) or old-fashioned whipstitching,
is not permitted for any books; with the
possible exception of newspapers.</p>

<p>20. In sewing three bands or tapes must be used
for eight-inch books, four for twelve-inch, etc.</p>

<p>21. Tapes, or bands, and back-lining must project
at least an inch and a quarter on each side of the
book.</p>

<p>22. All books should be lined on the back with
canton flannel as described in the chapter on Processes,
except in a few cases where it may be advisable
to use duck or a flesher. This eliminates lacing-on
of boards.</p>

<p>23. Adjoining leaves of fly leaves and end papers
must always be pasted together.</p>

<p>24. Books must be trimmed as little as possible.</p>

<p>25. All books should have rounded corners.</p>

<p>26. All books must have French joints.</p>

<p>27. All books, unless otherwise specified, will be
fastened finally into the covers by pasting down end
papers. Tight-back books will in addition have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
back glued to the book.</p>

<p>28. Books should be loose-back unless otherwise
specified.</p>

<p>29. Edges should be sprinkled unless the library
specifies gilding on top. The color used may be
varied to harmonize with the color of the book.</p>

<p>30. Books must be pressed until thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>31. Binders must keep a record of each book,
whether periodical or not, which has a volume
number.</p>

<p>This record, commonly known as a "rub" or "rub-off,"
shows the size of the book, kind of binding and
exact lettering. Whenever other volumes of the
same work or same periodical are received they will
be bound according to this record, unless the librarian
has specified a different material, or different lettering.
In such a case the matter must be referred to
the librarian before the book is bound. If a binder
receives a book with a volume number and has no
record of previous volumes, he should ask the librarian
for a sample volume, unless it is obviously a
book for which there could be no sample, such as the
first volume of a periodical giving contemporary
dates.</p>

<p>32. The binder is expected to paste in book-pockets
and book-plates when furnished by the library
but may charge extra for the work.</p>

<p>33. The best gold leaf must be used in lettering
unless cover is light enough in color to take ink.
Leather labels should never be used.</p>


<h3>FICTION AND JUVENILE BOOKS</h3><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to be fairly well proven that all fiction
and juvenile books should be bound in some kind of
leather, preferably cowhide.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Objections to this are
heard from time to time, but the objections come
chiefly from the large steel towns where the sulphur
in the air has a bad effect on leathers. In most communities
leather will outwear cloth and in any event
cloth becomes shabby, even when perfectly strong,
much more quickly than leather. When the French
joint is used the leather need not be pared and ordinarily
will outwear the paper of the book.</p>

<p>Follow general specifications as outlined above,
supplemented by the following:</p>

<p>1. Books should be bound in one-half cowhide
(American russia). Roan may be used if the librarian
is sure that it is good.</p>

<p>2. Fly-leaves should be made of white book
paper, 70 pounds to the ream and guarded with
jaconet.</p>

<p>It is apparent that when fly-leaves are guarded
with cloth they are sewed as a separate section and
not tipped on as is done in ordinary binding. Since
practically all fiction and juvenile books are oversewed,
it will not be necessary to carry the guard
around to the inner side of the fold.</p>

<p>3. End papers may be made of paper specially
made for the binder, but it should be equal in strength
to an 80-pound manila paper and should be guarded
with jaconet on the outside of the fold in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
way as fly-leaves.</p>

<p>4. If book is not oversewed the first and last sections
must be guarded with jaconet.</p>

<p>5. Nearly all books should be sewed with some
modern method of overcasting.</p>

<p>It is probable that in every lot of books sent to the
binder there will be some fiction and juvenile books
which could be sewed in the regular way through the
signatures either on bands or on tapes, but the number
is so small that the binder finds it easier to sew all
the books alike. In any event only those which have
the backs of the sections unbroken the entire length
and which, in addition, are seldom used, should be
sewed in the regular way.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> See footnote, page 66.</p></div>


<h3>NON-FICTION</h3>

<p>1. Books should be bound in full cloth.</p>

<p>2. Books in which the backs of sections are not
injured, or which cannot be easily mended may be
sewed regularly. The rest must be oversewed.</p>

<p>3. In all other respects the preceding specifications
should be followed.</p>


<h3>PERIODICALS</h3>

<p>There is no place in a small library where good
judgment will do more to make the library efficient
at a minimum cost than in the binding of periodicals.
The use of libraries for reference purposes is increasing
and the use of periodicals is made easy by means
of the periodical indexes. The enthusiastic librarian
who wishes to answer all questions will be tempted to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
bind more periodicals than are really needed, thus impairing
the efficiency of the book fund. On the other
hand, to some the cost of binding may seem so great
that some useful periodicals will remain unbound.
But it is not necessary to throw away unbound periodicals.
If they are to be used only now and then in
reference work, it is a good plan to wrap them in
stout manila paper with stiff boards on the outside,
letter carefully on the back and file away on the
shelves in their regular places among other periodicals.</p>

<p>Supplement the general specifications by the following:</p>

<p>1. Fly-leaves should be made of white book
paper, 80 pounds to the ream, guarded with jaconet
on both sides.</p>

<p>2. End papers may be made of special papers
used by the binder, but it is wise to have a 100-pound
manila guarded with jaconet on the outside and also
on the inside of the fold.</p>

<p>3. First and last sections must be guarded with
jaconet.</p>

<p>4. Books 10 inches in height should be sewed
regularly on four bands or on tapes one-quarter of
an inch wide; larger volumes on five bands or tapes.
Sew all-along, passing needle through center of tapes.</p>

<p>5. A millboard as heavy as the weight of the
book will allow must be used.</p>

<p>6. (<i>a</i>) Books should be bound in full cloth
made according to the specifications of the Bureau of
Standards. As light colors, which may be lettered
in ink, show dirt very readily it seems better to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a dark color and letter in gold.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In large reference or college libraries there
are certain periodicals that receive constant use. It
would be a mistake to bind such volumes in cloth,
because no cloth will endure the wear that they
receive. They should be bound in leather, preferably
Turkey or Niger morocco. On no account should
American russia be used.</p>

<p>7. If leather is used the sides should be covered
with Bureau of Standards cloth.</p>


<h3>NEWSPAPERS</h3>

<p>Because newspapers are printed on wretched
paper which it is freely admitted will disintegrate in
a comparatively short time, the question when to bind
and when to throw away is a hard one to decide. For
the small library it is surely unwise to bind any except
the local paper, which will be used from time to time
for local history. In many cases it may be wiser
simply to wrap the volumes to protect them from the
light and file them chronologically. The librarian of
the large library, however, no matter how disgusted
he may be with the poor quality of paper used finds
it necessary to bind a number of newspapers. When
bound they will last twenty-five years or more, during
which time they are sure to be used sufficiently to
warrant binding.</p>

<p>Newspapers must be kept away from light, heat
and moisture. If possible, keep in a dark closet until
ready for binding. Publishers of local papers ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to give a copy for binding.</p>

<p>1. Newspapers must be bound in one-half duck,
best quality.</p>

<p>It is never under any circumstances wise to bind
newspapers in leather. Duck, to be sure, gathers dirt
easily, but it seems to be the only material sufficiently
strong and long-lived for binding newspapers.</p>

<p>2. Fly-leaves and end papers should be made of
extra heavy paper well guarded inside and outside the
fold.</p>

<p>3. It is permissible to stitch sections lengthwise
before sewing regularly on bands, but oversewing is
preferable.</p>

<p>4. Boards of double thickness must be used. It
is best, perhaps, to make the boards by gluing or
pasting two boards of ordinary thickness together.</p>

<p>5. Corners should be covered with vellum tips.</p>

<p>6. Tight backs must be used.</p>

<p>7. Sides must be covered with paper.</p>

<p>This facilitates the handling of the volumes. If
cloth sides are used on newspapers it increases enormously
the labor in shelving them and even of using
them on ordinary library tables. In libraries that
can afford to shelve newspapers on patent shelving
with rollers, cloth sides are preferable.</p>

<p>8. Libraries that can afford it should use a fibre-filling
preservative on the edges. (See page 116 of
the Bulletin of the American Library Association for
1912.)</p>


<h3>REFERENCE BOOKS</h3><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Reference books should be bound in the same way
as fiction or juvenile books, except that morocco, instead
of cowhide, should be used for books constantly
handled. Books used only occasionally should be
covered with cloth made according to the Specifications
of the Bureau of Standards. Very heavy, thick
volumes, such as dictionaries, should have all the
strengthening devices and especially should have the
bands and canton flannel on the back placed in split
boards or between two boards glued together. It is
impossible to bind such books too strongly. In rare
cases it may be well to sew heavy books constantly
used on raised bands, to have leather corners, and a
strip of leather along the bottom of each board.</p>


<h3>LAW BOOKS</h3>

<p>Some of the professions have conventional ways
of binding professional books. In the law, for example,
it was formerly customary to bind all law
books in full sheep of the natural color. When sheep
fell into disrepute, the law publishers began to substitute
cloth similar in shade to the sheep generally
used&mdash;a decided gain for law libraries.</p>

<p>Supplement the general specifications by the following:</p>

<p>1. End papers and fly-leaves must be guarded
with jaconet, as described in specifications for fiction
and juvenile books, page 93.</p>

<p>2. First and last sections must be guarded with
jaconet.</p>

<p>3. All maps and charts must be backed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
muslin and not folded unless necessary.</p>

<p>4. (<i>a</i>) Bancroft Legal buckram (the lightest
shade made), or Holliston Mills Library buckram
No. 32, should be used for covering.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Books used constantly should be bound in
half Turkey morocco or Niger morocco.</p>


<h3>MUSIC</h3>

<p>1. The most essential quality of a well-bound
book of music is its ability to lie flat wherever
opened. It is unwise therefore to use any kind of
an overcast stitch in sewing. Regular sewing on
tapes, instead of bands, must be used.</p>

<p>2. The square at the bottom of the book should
be greater than at the top so that leaves will not
catch on the music-rack when turned over.</p>

<p>3. Imperial morocco cloth should be used for
covering. If hard usage is expected half cowhide,
with sides of some kind of washable cloth, is preferable.</p>

<p>4. Part music for various instruments or solos
with accompaniment must have one strong binding
for the part which takes the most space, with pocket
on the inside of the back cover to hold the other
parts. If these are bulky compensating guards should
be inserted in the back of the book.</p>


<h3>BOOKS OF ILLUSTRATIONS</h3>

<p>Every library finds it necessary to bind a few
books, such as Racinet's "Le costume historique,"
which have very little text and a great number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
illustrations. It is evident that the illustrations in
such books are most useful if kept in unbound form
in portfolios, but when kept in such a way they are
likely to be lost, torn, mutilated or misplaced.</p>

<p>1. Each plate should be guarded with thin, tough
paper and the guards overcast.</p>

<p>This insures a good strong sewing; in addition the
guard forms a hinge where it meets the plate and the
plate will lie flat and can easily be examined when
the book is opened.</p>

<p>2. Because of the artistic nature of such books,
they should be bound in one-half morocco, taking
extra care to see that acid-free leather is used.</p>

<p>3. Canton flannel and bands, or tapes, should be
inserted between split boards. If the book is very
heavy, it would be wise to line the back with duck or
a flesher rather than with canton flannel.</p>


<h3>COMMERCIAL BINDING FOR REFERENCE BOOKS</h3>

<p>While they are not a part of library binding, it
may not be amiss to include specifications for commercial
binding of heavy reference books, such as
dictionaries, cyclopedias, etc. It is done with the hope
that librarians will exert pressure upon the publishers
to induce them to adopt these or other specifications
which will produce equally good results.</p>

<p>1. Four tapes should be used in sewing; the tapes
must extend on each side of the book at least two
inches. The book should contain as many stitches
as possible, using the best four-strand cotton thread.
The thickness of the thread will depend somewhat<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
upon the number of pages in a signature. Books
should be sewed "all along" with no splitting of
signatures at head or tail.</p>

<p>2. First and last signatures should be reinforced
inside and outside of the fold with a strip of strong,
thin muslin which passes around the outside of the
end papers. The English cloth called jaconet is the
best for this purpose.</p>

<p>3. The second signature and the next to the last
should be reinforced with muslin on the inside of the
fold.</p>

<p>4. The end papers should also be lined on the
inside.</p>

<p>5. Illustrations should be guarded with muslin
which is folded around the next signature.</p>

<p>6. Books should be lined with a medium grade
of canton flannel, with the fuzzy side to the back and
extending from one-half inch from the head to
within one-half inch of the tail of the book, lapping
over at least two inches on the side.</p>

<p>7. The flannel, together with the tapes, should
be inserted between split boards.</p>

<p>8. Over the canton flannel, but not extending
over to the sides, there should be pasted a good quality
of linen, rope or manila paper of sufficient thickness
to make the book firm. In putting on this lining
paper paste instead of glue must be used.</p>

<p>9. Volumes should have French joints.</p>

<p>10. The best quality millboard of suitable thickness
with rounded corners should be used.</p>

<p>11. Leather should be made, if possible, according<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>
to the specifications of the London Society of Arts.
Niger morocco is probably the best. Volumes should
have leather corners as well as backs.</p>

<p>12. For cloth sides, Winterbottom's Imperial
morocco cloth, Bancroft's Legal buckram, or Holliston's
Library buckram should be used.</p>

<h3>BINDING BEFORE PURCHASE AND REINFORCING</h3>


<p>One way of economizing in libraries is to buy
books that have been bound in strong binding before
they come to the library. It is not, however, a universal
panacea which will reduce binding bills to a
minimum. On the contrary, if not used with caution,
this plan will result in the expenditure of large sums
of money for which the library will never receive a
return in actual wear of the books. Library binders
who adopt this scheme buy books in the sheets from
the publishers, put them into a strong binding and
sell them directly to the library. Mr. Cedric Chivers
of Bath, England, was the first to adopt this plan.
Later he started a bindery in this country, and since
then other binders have followed his practice. For
the librarian there are several advantages in this
method of buying books.</p>

<p>1. Books can be bound according to the library's
special needs before they have received any wear,
while the paper is fresh and clean. Books printed on
very thick, spongy paper must be sewed very strongly
and receive special reinforcements that are not necessary
on paper which is more suitable for binding. If
a good library binder buys the sheets from the publishers,
he can test the paper to see what kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
treatment it should receive, and he can then bind it
suitably for library wear. If the book is used in the
original publishers' binding it deteriorates much more
rapidly than when properly bound at the beginning.</p>

<p>2. The book can remain in circulation at the
time when it is most needed. Formerly one of the
greatest trials in public libraries was the necessity
of withdrawing from the shelves practically all the
copies of a popular novel in order to send them to
the bindery where they remained from four to six
weeks, the public meanwhile hurling anathemas at the
librarian for not providing sufficient copies of the
book. Not only were the books out of circulation
when most needed, but much time was used in preparing
them for the bindery, checking them up on
return, putting on the library marks of ownership,
making cards, marking pockets, etc., all of which
added to the expense. Today, in the case of new
novels which are sure to be popular, such troubles
are unnecessary. Instead of buying the original publishers'
binding, the wise librarian buys a sufficient
number of copies bound from the sheets; if the binding
is properly done, he need pay no more attention
to them until they are worn out. He has done what
he could to prevent the public from becoming dissatisfied,
and he has saved the cost of the work
required to send them to the bindery.</p>

<p>3. Not only has he served his public better and
saved the time of assistants, but in most cases he has
actually saved money on his binding bills. Let us
suppose that he pays $1.50 for a book bound from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the sheets; and suppose that he also buys a copy of
the same book in the publisher's cover at a cost of
$1.22, which, after it has been issued twenty times,
has to be bound at a cost of 50 cents, making a total
cost of $1.72. If they are issued the same number
of times there is a clear saving of 22 cents in favor
of the book bound from the sheets. As a matter of
fact, however, statistics kept by the Wilmington Institute
Free Library indicate that the first book will
be issued 125 times before it is discarded, and the
second 100 times&mdash;twenty before binding and eighty
afterward. If this be true, it is clear that there is a
further saving, provided that both have to be replaced
when finally worn out.</p>

<p>While these advantages are well worth considering,
the librarian should not necessarily get all his
books in this form. It is a plan which is peculiarly
advantageous in the case of fiction and those
few other books which are in constant use. In the
case of juvenile books one must be cautious. Juvenile
books, particularly books for boys, become soiled so
much more quickly than the adult books that they
frequently have to be discarded because they are dirty
rather than because they are worn out. If the books
were bound before purchase the library may have lost
money, because one can frequently buy a publisher's
book and rebind it more cheaply than he can purchase
the book bound from the sheets.</p>

<p>Most books in the classes should be purchased in
the regular publisher's binding unless they are constantly
used. In other words, the use a book is to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>
receive is the test of whether it should be bound from
the sheets before purchase. Having decided that the
use of a book warrants binding from the sheets, it is
well to consider other facts.</p>

<p>1. It may not always be wise to bind from the
sheets all the copies of a new book by a well-known
author whose works are always popular and likely to
continue so for years. If ten copies are approximately
sufficient for use during the first year, it is
safe to say that in most cases they will be too many
for the needs of the library during the second and
third years. If they are bound in leather before purchase
they will not wear out and during the third
and succeeding years a number of them may be deadwood
on the shelves. It is therefore wiser to buy a
few copies in leather binding and the others either
in a regular publishers' binding, or in some publisher's
cover reinforced. When these volumes have
come to the point where they need binding the period
of greatest popularity may have passed and they
may be withdrawn, thus saving the library the expense
of binding.</p>

<p>2. When the book is finally worn out and must
be withdrawn from circulation, the question always
arises, must it be replaced with a new copy? The
majority of fiction and juvenile books so replaced
are books of wide popularity. Occasionally a book,
such as Henry James' "Princess Casamassima," or
W. D. Howells' "Modern instance," is replaced
because the library must have it on the shelves, not
because it is popular. But ordinarily the popularity<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>
of a book is the determining factor in replacing worn-out
copies. The decision to replace carries with it
the decision to keep a book on the shelves indefinitely.
Since the book has proved its worth and is to receive
hard wear, the reasons which prevailed against buying
it in a strong binding when it was new no longer
exist. The strongest binding that can be obtained
suited to the strength of the paper is none too strong.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most vehement objection to books
bound from the sheets comes from those librarians
who have a strong sense of aesthetic values and who
claim that these books are not so attractive to the
eyes as the regular books in their bright and gay
publishers' covers. The objection is valid. It must
be admitted that the leather-covered books have the
appearance of strength and serviceability, but not of
beauty. If a reader knows that he wishes a particular
book, he will not be prevented from taking it because
of its appearance, but if it is bound in leather and
he knows nothing about it, he will very likely pass
it over and select some book which has a bright,
attractive cover. This is true even of adults, while of
children it is doubly true. A large part of the popularity
of that well-known book, "Fighting a fire," is
due to the attractive cover which almost always excites
the interest of boys who happen to see it.</p>

<p>Although the first cost of books bound from the
sheets is always greater than that of books in the
regular publishers' covers, it is hoped that the economy
of buying them under certain conditions has
been made clear. There is, however, a cheaper way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of buying some books which one would otherwise
obtain in this form. Every year many copies of
popular fiction and juvenile books find their way to
the shelves of second-hand book dealers. Some of
these copies show signs of wear, while some of them
are in excellent condition. In any event it is always
wise to submit a list of replacements to some large
dealer in second-hand books; to buy such books as
may be obtained from him (generally at considerably
less than one-half the published price); and to send
them at once to a good library binder for rebinding
before placing upon the shelves of the library. In
this way one should get from 25 per cent to 33-1/3 per
cent of fiction replacements in a substantial binding
at a cost much less than the cost of a book in the
original publishers' binding.</p>


<h3>REINFORCED BOOKS</h3>

<p>For those who wish strong bindings, but who
wish them attractive also, reinforced bindings can be
recommended. Reinforced books are those which
have been strengthened either by the publishers in the
regular course of manufacture, or by some binder who
takes the book as it comes from the publisher, removes
the cover, strengthens the book and puts it back into
the same cover. A reinforced book generally appears
in the attractive publisher's cover, and it always appears
in some form of cloth, never in leather.</p>

<p>Owing to the small number of times which books
in the original publishers' binding were issued, the
committee on binding of the American Library Association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
made an effort in 1906 to induce the publishers
to issue a special edition for library use. As it was
recognized that the publishers would not take kindly
to elaborate specifications for stronger bindings, the
improvements asked for were made as few in number
as possible. They were the following:</p>

<p>1. Sewed on three tapes (very small books sewed
on two tapes).</p>

<p>2. First and last signatures reinforced with
muslin.</p>

<p>3. Cloth strip in joints pasted on fly leaf and
sewed through.</p>

<p>4. Thin strong muslin over backs.</p>

<p>An attempt to demand hand-sewed books was
abandoned when it was discovered that this stipulation
added greatly to the cost of the binding without
noticeably increasing its strength. The main strength
of a book bound according to these specifications lay
in the guarding of the first and last signatures.</p>

<p>The honor of issuing the first reinforced book for
library use belongs to Charles Scribner's Sons Co.,
who in the summer of 1906 bound 1500 copies of
F. Hopkinson Smith's "Tides of Barnegat." Their
specifications, based on those submitted by the
A. L. A. committee on binding, required that:</p>

<p>1. Signatures contain not more than sixteen
pages;</p>

<p>2. First and last signatures be guarded with
muslin before sewing;</p>

<p>3. First and last signatures be oversewed (actually<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>
they were run through a sewing machine);</p>

<p>4. Lining papers be guarded with strong drill
and sewed through;</p>

<p>5. The book be sewed on two tapes;</p>

<p>6. Highest grade super be used for back-lining;</p>

<p>7. Books be glued to the back of the cover;
making a tight back book;</p>

<p>8. Buckram be used for the covers instead of the
regular publisher's cover.</p>

<p>The extra cost of the book was ten cents, and it
was an excellent piece of work. In actual wear the
books far exceeded the hopes of those who favored
the plan, for they all went through the period of
greatest popularity without being withdrawn from
circulation. When they came to the point where they
could no longer be circulated, most of them were discarded
instead of being sent to the bindery.</p>

<p>The initial success of the plan induced other publishers
to try the experiment. In 1908 one hundred
and twenty different books could be obtained in reinforced
bindings from seventeen publishers. Among
these publishers were the firms of Century Company,
Harper, Houghton, Little Brown &amp; Company, McClurg,
Putnam, Scribner's, Stokes, and Warne. Some
of these books were well-bound, the publishers evidently
making a conscientious effort to meet the
demands of the committee; others were makeshifts
not worth one-half the extra cost.</p>

<p>The success of "Tides of Barnegat" encouraged
Charles Scribner's Sons to give the experiment further
trial, and from time to time during a period of
several months this firm issued books bound in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
way. In no case, however, was the initial success
repeated. After the experiments had been tried by
the different publishers for several months the obstacles
to the plan, several of which had been foreseen,
grew greater rather than less, and in the end
the publishers gave up the plan of providing special
editions of new fiction and juvenile books for library
use.</p>

<p>The main obstacle to the successful culmination
of the plan lay in the inability of librarians to order
books before publication, and in the inability of publishers
to make special editions after the book had
been published. The success of "Tides of Barnegat"
was due largely to the fact that the author and book
were well known in advance of publication. Librarians
knew at once that they wanted the book and the
orders were filed promptly. In the case of nearly
every other book which Scribner published in this way
librarians could not decide until they had actually
seen the book, or at least had seen reviews of it.
Quite naturally they sent in few orders for the books.
On the other hand Scribner did not care to bind a
large number of books in special binding unless they
had some assurance that the books would be sold;
and they could not at any time afford to manufacture
a very small number. It seemed impossible to
bridge this gap which existed between the publisher
and the librarian.</p>

<p>Other reasons which worked against the success
of the plan were:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The apathy of the library world in general.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
In spite of efforts made both by publishers and by
those librarians specially interested; in spite of the
proved success and economy of the best reinforced
bindings, librarians in general paid little attention to
them.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The opposition of booksellers. This opposition
was not violent at any time; but a special
edition for one class of buyers inevitably entailed
more labor upon jobbers and booksellers with no
financial return, since there was no discount on the
10c. extra cost. It followed that orders from librarians
for the special library editions were filled by
some jobbers with regular editions; and the time required
to exchange the copy of a regular edition for
one of a special edition was generally sufficient to
prevent the librarian from returning the books. Had
it been possible to have one central bureau to bunch
orders and to distribute them, greater success might
have resulted.</p>

<p>While the effort to induce publishers to issue
special library editions and to keep them in stock
was a failure, there were nevertheless good results
from the venture. While most of the commercial
bindings are no better to-day than they were ten
years ago, yet the publishers know that something
better is needed for library use. Small books which
are used by children and receive hard usage are as a
rule much stronger bound than formerly, and will
last as long as they are needed. As one direct result
of the agitation, the well-known Everyman's set can
now be obtained in a library binding. Certain large
reference books, such as Webster's and the Century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
dictionaries, U. S. Catalog, etc., have been put into
the strongest possible binding. In these cases the
publishers have tried to meet the demands of librarians.</p>

<p>When the publishers ceased to make special editions
for libraries several library binders undertook
to supply books in this form. Their method was to
buy the books from the publishers, remove the covers,
resew the books in the most approved library
style and replace the books in the publisher's covers.
When this cover wears out the sewing is so good
that it is only necessary to recover either with a regular
leather-back binder's cover, or with a home-made
cloth cover. By this method the librarian is
assured of a book in the same cover as the regular
edition, the necessity of sending orders in advance of
publication is obviated, and the publishers, jobbers
and booksellers do not have to keep a stock of a special
edition. In practice the plan works well.</p>

<p>Librarians for years have been annoyed because
certain books, such as the Brownie books, have
given such poor service no matter how they were
bound. In the original boards they went to pieces
very quickly and the paper was of such a character
that they were hard to rebind. The strong leather
bindings bound from the sheets were too strong because
the paper wore out long before the binding.
In 1912 books of this character, through the initiative
of Mr. H. R. Huntting in Springfield, Massachusetts,
were sewed by the Samson-back method, a
strong machine sewing; they were then covered with<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>
cloth and the paper covers, so attractive to children,
pasted on the outside. The cost of the books was
much less than that of the leather-back binding and
they were much more attractive. The Samson-back
method of reinforcement therefore practically solved
the problem of binding large thin books with wide
margins at the back, precisely the books that had
given librarians the most trouble.</p>

<h3>COST</h3>


<p>Binding is a work of repair, not one of expansion,
and consequently the amount spent for this
purpose adds little to the resources of the library.
The modern librarian does not begrudge money for
salaries; heat, light and the general up-keep are
items that cannot be reduced materially in most libraries.
But money spent on binding reduces the
funds available for new books. Therefore, a study
of the many ways in which binding bills can be
made smaller is well worth while.</p>

<p>Two elements, material and labor, enter into the
cost of binding, labor of course forming the larger
part. Since the cost of labor varies in different parts
of the United States, it is impossible to give figures
of cost applicable to all places. Furthermore, as the
cost of both material and labor is increasing constantly
any statement made at the present time might
be wrong a year from now.</p>

<p>So far as figures of cost are concerned, it therefore
seems best to discuss maximum and minimum
figures. On this basis it is fair to assume that it will
not be necessary at any time in the near future to
pay more than fifty cents a book for fiction and juvenile
books eight inches or less in height, bound in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>
cowhide, government cloth, or the more expensive
imperial morocco cloth. For this amount the librarian
should get the best binding obtainable. As high
a price as this is actually charged by a few binders
only, some of whom are justified in so doing because
they give full value for the money, or because the
cost of their labor is high.</p>

<p>If less than thirty-five cents is paid for fiction
and juvenile books eight inches high, it is probable
that the binding is not serviceable and therefore not
economical; but in rare cases bindings costing thirty
cents a volume will give excellent service. When
low prices are charged the librarian should be sure
that, taking the ratio of cost to circulation into consideration,
he is getting full value. In general, it
may be said that he who gets fiction and juvenile
books well bound for less than forty cents a volume
is to be congratulated. Naturally, this statement
does not apply to the large libraries which bind a
large number of books every month, and can therefore
obtain better rates than the smaller libraries.</p>

<p>For books bound in cowhide or cloth, the cost
increases at the rate of from fifteen to twenty cents
a volume for every two inches in height.</p>

<p>The price of the smallest volumes bound in
morocco is considerably greater than of those bound
in other materials, and the increase according to size
is also somewhat greater. One dollar is the highest
price paid within the knowledge of the writer for
an eight-inch morocco book, and sixty cents the
lowest price. The difference in the value of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
work about corresponds to the difference in price.</p>

<p>Periodicals bound in government cloth, or duck,
may cost from fifty-five cents to eighty cents a volume
ten inches or less in height, increasing fifteen cents
to twenty cents a volume for every two inches in
height.</p>

<p>Newspapers well bound should not cost less than
$2.00 a volume, nor over $4.00. More variations
will be found in the prices for newspapers than in
any other kind of binding.</p>

<p>Most binders are paid a certain amount for books
eight inches high or less, the prices differing according
to the material used. The price in a few cases
increases with each inch or fraction thereof in
height to ten inches; in most cases the increase is for
each two inches or fraction. For example, a book
which measures eight and one quarter inches in
height is charged for at the ten inch rate. One
which measures ten and one quarter inches at the
twelve inch rate. Sometimes an extra charge for
books which are much thicker than usual is justified.</p>

<p>The following schedule covers practically all the
different sizes and materials which the librarian must
take into consideration. The prices given are those
actually charged by a good library binder.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING COST</h3><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Following is a statement of plans for cutting down
the cost of binding, a few of them being obviously
makeshifts for the benefit of poor or very small
libraries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books Bound Before Purchase</span></p>

<p>Under this head will be found (in Chapter 6) a
full statement of reasons for buying books bound from
the sheets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reprints Bound Before Purchase</span></p>

<p>The cheap reprints of popular novels which cost
less than one-half as much as the original edition,
although attractive in appearance, are very poorly
bound and if bought in original covers must be rebound
within a short time after they are first placed on
the shelves. Some librarians find that it pays to send
orders for books which can be obtained in cheap
reprints directly to their binders, who buy the books
and rebind them in the regular half-leather binding
which the library uses for its rebound fiction and
juvenile. He bills the books to the library at the
cost of the volume plus the cost of binding, the total
in any event being considerably less than one dollar.
Not over ninety cents should be paid and eighty-five
cents is the general price for such books. In this
way the library gets a book in a good, strong library
binding for less than the cost of the original edition
in publisher's cover. Furthermore all labor involved
in sending the book to the bindery and receiving it
again&mdash;no inconsiderable item&mdash;is eliminated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second-Hand Books</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Akin to the foregoing plan is the practice which
some libraries have of sending lists of replacements
to dealers in second-hand books and having all books
obtained in this way rebound at once before putting
them into circulation. Moreover this arrangement
eliminates the time and labor necessary to send a book
to the bindery. Binderies in large cities can undertake
to supply second-hand books, with advantages
both to themselves and to the libraries employing
them. The library is relieved from the necessity of
searching for second-hand volumes, while the binder
can well afford to do this service for a stated price
per volume which will be reasonable from the library
point of view, but which will allow the binder profit
on all books which he can find at very cheap prices.
When such a plan is adopted the binder should understand
that the library wants neither the cheap books
printed on wretched paper and having very small
print, nor the very fine editions with colored illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reinforcements</span></p>

<p>A reinforced book is one which has been removed
from the original publisher's cover, strengthened in
various ways and put back into the same cover. (See
chapter on this subject, page 108.) In its best form
it means the complete resewing of the book with an
overcast stitch. It is advisable to buy such books
frequently, since they preserve the attractive publisher's
cover and since they can also be recovered by
the library itself without resewing. Statistics kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
by the Wilmington Institute Free Library show that
such books when properly recovered give as good
relative service as those which have been bound before
purchase. The main advantage lies in the
elimination of the time necessary to send them to the
bindery and the greater length of service which they
give at the height of their popularity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recovering at the Library</span></p>

<p>Many books which come to the binding department
require rebinding in order to put them into the
best condition, but the books will be used so little
that rebinding would not pay. In the numerous
cases in which the sewing is in good condition it will
be possible to recover them at the library and letter
them by hand. In cases where the sewing is poor
it will be possible to resew and recover. Such books
are neither so strong nor so attractive as books which
have been wholly rebound, but they can be recovered
at an expenditure of less than fifteen cents a volume,
as against forty to fifty cents a volume for binding,
and are in sufficiently good condition to wear a long
time, perhaps as long as the library needs them. (For
description of the process of recovering see page 185.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Discarding Valueless Books</span></p>

<p>In the preceding case it has been taken for granted
that the books in question add something to the
resources of the library and that they must be kept.
Books that have outlived their usefulness because they
have been superseded by later editions, or by other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
books more authoritative, in all except the largest
libraries should be discarded. (For arguments in
favor of this see Chapter 8, <a href="#Page_131">p. 131.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leather vs. Cloth</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding that he is repeating himself, the
writer wishes to emphasize one point. It may almost
be made a general rule, though like other rules, it
will not work well at all times. Never bind a seldom
used book in leather, or a much used one in cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheap Editions</span></p>

<p>Money may be saved by replacing books which
need rebinding with good editions cheaper than the
cost of binding. (See (<i>f</i>), page 129.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proper Care</span></p>

<p>The life of the book in the library may be prolonged
in several ways.</p>

<p>1. In opening the leaves of uncut books at the
top the paper knife should be carried to the back of
the book, using a dull knife that is thin, long and
tapering.</p>

<p>2. Many books should be carefully opened before
being placed on the shelves. This is done by resting
the book on its back and dropping the covers on the
table. Taking a few leaves at a time first at the front
and then at the back, press them down carefully until
the middle of the book is reached. If this be done
there is little chance that the back of the book will<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>
be broken if the book is suddenly opened.</p>

<p>3. Books should not be pressed tightly together
on the shelves.</p>

<p>4. They should not be piled on other books resting
on their fore-edge.</p>

<p>5. They should not be pulled from the shelves
by the head bands.</p>

<p>6. They should be dusted frequently.</p>

<p>7. They should be kept upright on the shelves
instead of half-fallen over.</p>

<p>8. In every way they should be handled as if they
were books, not bricks.</p>

<h3>PREPARING FOR THE BINDERY</h3>


<p>To decide properly what books should be rebound
and how they should be rebound is not a simple matter
nor one which should be left to an inexperienced or
uneducated assistant. In addition to a good working
knowledge of materials and processes the assistant in
charge of this work should have a general knowledge
of books&mdash;paper, editions, prices, literary value, timeliness,
etc.&mdash;and good judgment in deciding whether
a book should be bound or whether it should be
mended, recased, wrapped in paper, recovered, or
thrown away. The binding, therefore, should be in
the hands of an assistant who understands the demands
of this department of library service, and for
economy's sake as well as for the sake of efficiency
it should not be shifted from one person to another.</p>

<p>Mr. Dana has shown in his "Notes on bookbinding
for libraries" how essential it is that binding assistants
should know books. Credit for much of what here
appears in support of that viewpoint is due him and
is herewith acknowledged.</p>

<p>In considering the binding of fiction and juvenile
books the following are some of the questions which
the binding assistant must ask and decide before determining
whether a book is to go to the shelves in a
new dress, or to the junk-man as waste paper:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Is the book in such poor condition that it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
cannot be rebound or recased? If so, it must be
discarded. While this decision is generally easy to
make, it is sometimes made difficult by books which
are in too good condition to throw away and in too
poor condition to rebind. In such cases the decision
must depend on the popularity of the book. If very
popular, it may be wise to rebind it, for it must be
remembered that good library binders can accomplish
wonders with books that are in poor condition.</p>

<p>Sometimes the question arises whether the book
is in poor enough condition to need rebinding. Perhaps
it will survive a few more issues just as it stands.
If the book is a trifle shaky in its covers, the decision
should be to rebind. The binder can do a better job
at this time than he can when the book becomes more
worn, and the life of the book will be prolonged by
prompt binding. If the assistant decides not to
rebind it, the book will be issued only a few more
times before it will have to be withdrawn from circulation
and sent to the repair room again. The
result is a greater loss of time with no actual gain in
wear.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Is the book much read? If it is an old one
that is evidently popular, it is reasonable to suppose
that it is the policy of the library to supply the demand
for this book, and the book will be rebound as a
matter of course. A decision about new books which
are popular is harder to make because it is fair to
ask:</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Is the demand falling off? It is here that
the assistant must show good judgment. It may be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>
that the book can be rebound easily with profit, if
there is a sufficient demand to keep all the copies in
circulation. It may be that the book is waning in
popularity and that other copies in the library are
ample to supply present demands. If they are, the
copy in hand should be canceled, since the cost of
binding will then be saved. But the assistant should
ascertain the condition of the remaining copies. Let
us take the case of a novel which has been withdrawn
from circulation because it needs rebinding. The
assistant looks at the record of circulation on the
book card or pocket and discovers that last year the
book was issued four times a month, while now it
is issued only twice a month. He finds also that
there are four other copies. These four copies should
be sufficient to meet present demands, and the book
in hand may be withdrawn. But suppose that further
investigation shows that two of the four copies are in
very poor condition and cannot be rebound. If he
withdraws the one in hand, only two good copies will
remain, and perhaps these are not sufficient to supply
the demand. On the other hand, it is possible that
they are sufficient to supply the demand. In any
event, the situation is one which requires a knowledge
of the book itself, its popularity with the public, and
general good judgment. The question may be
summed up in this way:</p>

<p>1. It is cheaper to rebind a book than it is to
discard it and later be obliged to buy a new copy.</p>

<p>2. It is cheaper to discard a book when it seems
assured that the book's popularity is over, than to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>
bind it and have it remain for years unused.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If the book is much used, is it a book that
the library wishes to circulate? Every library has
certain books on its shelves of which those in authority
somewhat disapprove, but which are very popular
and not poor enough to be done away with altogether.
It is sometimes the policy to supply only partially
the demand for such books; sometimes to discard
them entirely when worn out. The good binding
assistant will remember the titles of these books and
use good judgment in dealing with them when they
come into his hands.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) If the book is not much read, is it a standard
work? For example, in the case of a work of Anthony
Trollope the assistant discovers that it was
issued only once during the last year and that it is
the only copy in the library. If he does not "know
books," he will be led to believe that the book has no
value and will cancel it. In a large library an action
of this sort would be unwise; in a small library the
decision would depend upon the particular title. Most
libraries keep a book of this particular class in order
to supply the occasional demand for it. There are
many books not written by men with the reputation
of Anthony Trollope which, nevertheless, have intrinsic
worth and have a small circle of admirers. They
may not have great merit, but on no account should
the library be without them. As examples of books
of this kind we may take Mrs. Brush's "Colonel's
opera cloak" and Theodore Winthrop's "John Brent."</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Can the book be replaced with a good reprint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
which will wear as long as a new binding and cost
less? While there are not many cases in which this
can be done, the assistant should watch for them.
The most noteworthy reprints which will meet these
requirements are the volumes in Everyman's Library.
In the original Everyman's edition these were entirely
unsuited for library use, but in 1910 they were all put
into a strong library binding. In the cloth edition
they sell for thirty-five cents a volume and can easily
be issued from forty to fifty times before being discarded.
This makes the cost for each issue as small
as can be obtained by binding higher-priced editions.</p>

<p>The following case, which actually happened, illustrates
the point, although the books are not fiction.
Grote's "History of Greece," in twelve volumes, was
in bad condition; several of the cloth backs were
torn and the sewing of all the volumes was loose. It
was decided to send the books to be rebound at a cost
of $5.40. Before doing so, the list of Everyman's
Library was consulted and it was found that the work
could be obtained in that form in twelve volumes at
a cost of $4.20, a clear saving of $1.20, or over 20
per cent. The work was seldom used, yet it was
necessary to have the set on the shelves; the Everyman's
edition answered every purpose, and will undoubtedly
last as long as the rebound set would have
done. Unfortunately, owing to copyright provisions,
comparatively few of the books which are constantly
wearing out can be obtained in this edition.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Is it an old edition, with poor paper and
poor type? A book of this sort should never be rebound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
but should be discarded and a new copy purchased
even if the cost of a new copy be much greater
than that of rebinding.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) If the book is the only copy in the library
and is read not oftener than once in ten years, should
it be kept because it is important historically? Good
examples of this class of unused books are the works
of Charles Brockden Brown. They are not interesting
at the present time, but when first published were
much read. Every student of American literature
should read them, and they should be on the shelves
of all except the small libraries. Here again good
judgment is called for on the part of the assistant.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Is the book used so seldom that it can be
recased or recovered by the library? The process of
recasing (described on page 184) can be used in the
case of small-sized books which have covers showing
little evidence of wear, and which do not receive hard
usage. The process of recovering (described on page
185) can be used on leather-bound books which have
cracked at the joints. In either case the sewing must
be perfectly sound.</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>) Finally, let us suppose that we have asked
all the foregoing questions and are still undecided
what to do. There will be very few cases of the kind.
Perhaps the best solution is to wrap the book in
paper, letter it with author, title and call number,
and transfer it from the fiction shelves to the regular
literature shelves. It may stay there for years unused
and yet be at hand when finally called for.</p>

<p>With books other than fiction and juvenile many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of the same questions must be asked. In addition,
however, it is sometimes necessary to ask the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Are there later editions which are more
valuable? This question will arise with frequency
especially in the case of scientific, technical and reference
books, and careful judgment must be exercised
in making decisions. It often happens that a later
edition of a technical book has little more value than
the one which precedes it; frequently it entirely
supersedes the earlier edition. In the one case the
book can be rebound with profit, in the other it is
best to discard it and buy the latest edition. Some
libraries keep all the editions of a book for historical
purposes; but most libraries, especially the smaller
ones, will do better to discard older editions when
they are superseded by later ones. Sometimes a
book has no later edition, but its place has been entirely
taken by the work of other authors. In such
cases it should be remembered that an out-of-date
technical book in the hands of an inexperienced person
frequently causes more harm than good. It may
cost more to buy a new book than to rebind an old
one; yet this is exactly what should be done in every
such case if the funds of the library permit.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) May not the library be better off without
either the book or a substitute? In the past librarians
have hesitated to discard any book which has
once been placed on the shelves. They have believed
that all printed matter has value and that a book
which belongs to the library is sacred and must on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
no account be destroyed. It is difficult to defend
such an attitude. If we admit for the time being
that the librarian never makes mistakes in acquiring
books, still it is sure to happen that many
books will outlive their usefulness, except as a part
of the history or bibliography of the subject. Why
should they be kept on the shelves when they are not
used and ought not to be used? It cannot, of course,
be admitted that the librarian makes no mistakes in
acquiring books; every library in the country will
show examples of poor selection. Why, after a mistake
has been made, refuse to admit it? If the
original purchase (or acceptance of a gift) was a
mistake, to keep the book on the shelves simply perpetuates
the mistake and adds to the expense of
maintenance. It is no crime to discard a book. On
the contrary, in many cases, it is the only sensible
thing to do. In doubtful cases, however, the book
should be kept.</p>


<h3>ARRANGEMENT</h3>

<p>If the final decision is to bind the book the next
step is to arrange the book in the way in which it
should be bound. The question of collation is one
on which there has been a difference of opinion.
Some librarians have claimed that it is best to collate
books at the library in order to prevent imperfect
books being bound, since it is always disappointing
to discover, after a book has been bound, that it is
incomplete. In the great majority of cases, however,
collation is a waste of time, since good binders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
refuse to bind imperfect volumes. In the case of
very valuable books, especially those with many
plates, and even in the case of less valuable books
which have many illustrations not paged-in, it may
be best to collate at the library since it is obviously
unfair to the binder to expect him to be responsible
for anything except the main paging. Fiction or
juvenile books may sometimes be bound when one or
two pages are missing. Juvenile books, especially,
often go to the bindery with missing pages. Many
times these missing pages are not especially important
and in these cases it seems more economical to
bind the book than to buy a new copy. If the number
of missing pages is not too great they may be typewritten
from other copies. Books other than fiction
or juvenile should seldom be bound in an imperfect
condition.</p>

<p>Another exception to the rule of sending books
uncollated is in the case of popular periodicals, such
as Scribner's, Harper's, Century, etc., where the library
has only one copy which it binds. Since periodicals
frequently become torn and mutilated and
must be replaced it will save delay in having the volumes
bound, if the collation is done at the library.</p>

<p>But while collation is generally unnecessary, arrangement
in proper order is essential. In dealing
with periodicals this is not always an easy task.
They should first be examined to see that all the
numbers are in hand, and that there is a title-page
and an index. It would seem as if there were little
chance to go astray in doing this, yet the vagaries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
periodicals are innumerable and nothing must be
taken for granted. If only five monthly numbers
are found when there should be six to complete the
volume, it is not best to conclude hastily that it is incomplete.
Sometimes the cover indicates that two
numbers are published in one. If it is not so indicated
one must look at the paging. If the paging is
consecutive, and there is a title-page and index, it is
safe to assume that the volume is complete, even if a
number is apparently missing.</p>

<p>The general rule for arranging periodicals is:
Place title page at the beginning, followed by table
of contents, text, and index at the end. Periodicals
in English are generally easy to arrange, though
even in this case one must know whether the periodical
in hand is in the habit of publishing supplements
which are paged separately, but which are called for
by the table of contents. If such supplements are
omitted the volume is incomplete. An example of a
periodical of this class was the Annals of the American
Academy of Political and Social Science, before
it changed to its method of issuing each number as a
separate volume. Many volumes of English periodicals
such as All the Year Round, Household Words,
etc., have been bound without the Christmas supplements,
which those periodicals always issued. A few
periodicals in English have two or more sets of
pagings either in each number, or in some of the
numbers and not in others. When the numbers are
taken apart and the proper pagings grouped together,
the table of contents will generally indicate how these
should be arranged. But if not, it is usually readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
apparent which is the main paging and which the
minor paging or pagings.</p>

<p>Though rarely found in periodicals printed in
English, this exasperating condition of affairs frequently
exists in foreign periodicals. The Germans
are especially fond of printing several different parts
in the same number. Frequently a long monograph
will begin in the first number of a volume and extend
through two or more volumes. When completed
it may or may not have a special title-page
and index of its own. Perhaps the table of contents
of the last volume in which part of it has appeared
will call for it as a supplement to that volume. Perhaps
it does not. In any event the paging must be
removed from the first and succeeding volumes until
the monograph is finally complete. If it is not called
for by any regular title-page or table of contents, it
may be bound separately. Sometimes a periodical
will appear in two or more parts each month, each
part covering some phase of the larger subject indicated
by the general title of the periodical. These
parts will be paged separately and numbered differently
but will have the same kind of cover, and care
must be used to keep the proper parts together.
Peculiarities and irregularities of this sort make periodicals
veritable puzzles, some of which it may take
months to solve.</p>

<p>In arranging periodicals, front covers having a
different color from the text must be kept to facilitate
use.</p>

<p>Advertisements as a rule should not be bound.
Since they are a part of the history of the times, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
is desirable for a few of the largest libraries to bind
the advertising pages of one or two numbers a year
in each periodical. Other libraries should throw them
away. It is not necessary to remove them entirely
before sending the volumes to the bindery; tearing
down two or three inches on pages which are to be
discarded is sufficient indication to the binder that
they are not to be bound.</p>

<p>Several magazines, such as McClure's and Everybody's,
have, for several years, made a practice of
leaving articles unfinished in the main paging and
continuing them on advertising pages. This is an
annoying practice since great care must be taken to
see that all text matter is complete, even if it becomes
necessary to bind all advertising pages.</p>

<p>Many periodicals, especially those of a scientific
character, contain plates which are not paged-in. If
these are scattered through the text they may be
allowed to stay there, but if they are grouped together
at the end of each number they should be
placed together in proper order at the end of the
complete volume.</p>

<p>The vagaries of periodical publishers are shown
as much in the way in which they issue (or do not
issue) title-pages and indexes as in any other way.
The proper way, which is seldom done, is to issue
both title-page and index in the last number of each
volume. Some publishers issue them in the first
number of the next volume; some at various times
during the publication of the succeeding volume.
Some publish a title-page at the beginning of the first<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
number of a volume and an index when the spirit
moves. Some publish a title-page but no index or
table of contents. Others publish a title-page and
table of contents but do not send them unless requested
to do so. Many publish neither title-page nor
index, and perfectly reputable periodicals which have
published these essential parts of a periodical for
twenty years or more will suddenly cease publishing
them. It is evident that title-pages and indexes are
nuisances in preparing periodicals for the bindery.</p>

<p>The assistant in charge should keep a record
showing (<i>a</i>) which publishers must be asked to send
title-pages and indexes, and this should be done as
soon as possible after the volumes are complete;
(<i>b</i>) in which number of a periodical title-pages and
indexes may be looked for if they come regularly;
(<i>c</i>) which periodicals do not publish title-pages and
indexes.</p>

<p>If lack of funds makes it impossible to bind periodicals
and they must be wrapped in paper it is
highly important that title-pages and indexes be included,
since it may be impossible to obtain them
when funds permit binding.</p>

<p>Changes in the size of periodicals are a cause of
annoyance. The annoyance is not great when the
change is from a large quarto to an octavo, for the
cost of binding an octavo is considerably less than
that of a quarto. Unfortunately, the present tendency
is almost wholly the other way. Many periodicals,
for years published in a comfortable octavo
size have been changed to a much larger size. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in itself is exasperating, but in addition the publishers
apparently make no effort to change the size
with the beginning of a new volume, so that part of
a volume will be of one size and part of another. In
such cases the troubles of the binding assistant may
be readily imagined.</p>

<p>While it is highly important to bind only complete
volumes of periodicals, it is occasionally permissible
to bind volumes with guards for missing numbers
which may be inserted later if they are obtained.
This method makes it possible to put a volume into
permanent form better suited for use than unbound
numbers, and prevents further loss of numbers
already in hand. It can be done only when the
numbers are very thin, particularly in the case of
newspapers.</p>

<p>Quite a number of periodicals have so few pages
in each number that a complete volume makes a
very thin book. In such cases it is best to bind two
volumes in one at the cost of one.</p>

<p>Among other material which passes through the
hands of a binding assistant are the annual reports
of various organizations&mdash;religious, charitable, fraternal,
governmental, etc. In large libraries these
must be bound for permanent preservation. In small
libraries the annual reports of all local organizations
should be bound if funds permit, others wrapped in
paper and lettered on the wrapper. Whether they
are to be bound or wrapped in paper, they should be
grouped by regular periods, preferably five or ten
reports in a volume, according to size, following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
decades or half decades.</p>


<h3>INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BINDER</h3>

<p>Having decided that the volume must be bound
and having arranged it in its proper order, the next
step is to indicate to the binder how it is to be bound
and lettered. Various methods have been used to
indicate style and lettering. Some libraries have an
elaborate binding slip, giving on one side the different
materials, colors, etc., and having the other divided
into panels for lettering. A slip is made for
each book and the binder follows it carefully. Some
libraries arrange an arbitrary system with the binder
making one letter or figure indicate much that otherwise
would have to be written in full. For example,
"C" under such an arrangement might mean "Bind
in one-half red cowhide with green cloth sides."
Some librarians give a general blanket order to bind
all fiction in one way and all juvenile books in
another.</p>

<p>For most books in English, except periodicals,
lettering need not be indicated on a binding slip. All
that is necessary is to underscore lightly on the title
page the first letter of words which must be used.
The call number may be put on a binding slip enclosed
in the book, or in the case of fiction and juvenile books,
it may be penciled lightly on the title page, thus
doing away altogether with the binding slip. If there
is a chance for misunderstanding on the part of the
finisher, or if an author's real name must be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
instead of a pseudonym which appears on the title
page, a binding slip must be filled out giving exact
lettering.</p>

<p>While exact lettering on a binding slip is not
essential for ordinary books, it is necessary for
periodicals, each set of which should be bound and
lettered uniformly. This may be assured by making
out a binding slip giving in full the title, dates covered,
volume number and call number, if one is used.
The slip goes to the bindery with the book, and when
the volume is returned is filed so that when the next
volume is to be bound the slip can be consulted and
a new one written with the necessary changes in
volume number and dates. The chief value of the
slip is to show exactly how the previous volume has
been bound, so that the following volumes can be
made uniform if possible.</p>

<p>A carbon copy of binding slips for periodicals
should be made, to be kept at the library for charging
purposes.</p>

<p>When binding volumes which are a part of a set,
other than a periodical, a slip must be made to be kept
on file so that when another volume of the set comes
to hand it will not be necessary to visit the shelves
to see whether other volumes have been bound and
how they have been bound.</p>

<p>In finishing periodicals the position of lettering
and the size of type used may be kept uniform if the
binder takes what is called a "rub" or "rub-off" of
the book after it is lettered and keeps it on file at
the bindery. This can easily be made by laying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sheet of thin, but tough, paper over the back and
rubbing it with shoemaker's heel-ball which will show
white lettering on a black background. When the
next volume comes to the bindery the "rub-off" shows
exact height of boards, exact position of lettering and
size of type.</p>

<p>A few libraries have had a dummy back made for
each periodical showing color and kind of material
in addition to other details. But the cost of a dummy
is not slight and a new one must be made whenever
any change in title or size occurs. Large college or
reference libraries may need dummy backs for their
numerous sets of foreign periodicals having various
marks, such as umlauts, etc., over or under letters.
When a library operates its own bindery it is possible
to send the last bound volume as a sample. While
this adds much to the routine, its main advantage is
that it eliminates the possibility of mistakes due to
defective dummy or indistinct "rub-off."</p>


<h3>LETTERING</h3>

<p>It is necessary that binders understand exactly
how books are to be lettered, what kind of type to
use and the position on the back of the book which
each item of information must have. There are differences
of opinion as to the best ways of lettering,
but it is essential that every librarian have uniformity
in his own library, even if he disagrees with his fellow
workers. In all lettering a bold, clear type should be
used, and all figures should be in Arabic, since it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
plainer than Roman.</p>

<p>In most leather bindings the back is divided into
five or six panels, making it possible to obtain uniformity
by setting aside each panel for a definite
purpose. If desired, another narrow panel may be
made in which to stamp a mark of ownership. Paneling
is a useful device in the case of books which are
eight inches or more in height, but in the case of
juvenile books and fiction it may be omitted entirely.
As most of these books require simply author, title
and call number, if one be used, the device of paneling
adds to the labor in binding and serves no useful
purpose in the library. It should be used on most
other books bound in leather and on all periodicals
bound in cloth or duck.</p>

<p>Which shall go at the top of the book, author or
title? In favor of the title it can be claimed that all
publishers letter the title first with the author second;
and since in non-fiction the books in publishers' covers
on the shelves will outnumber the rebound books, it is
advisable to put the title first in order to have uniformity.
On the other hand, it can be claimed that
the arrangement under the class is by author, that
most library assistants look for the author rather than
the title, and that it is therefore advisable to put the
most important item of information at the top in the
position of greatest prominence. In the opinion of
the writer this advantage outweighs any other.</p>

<p>It may be assumed, therefore, that the best arrangement
is author, title, volume number if necessary,
and call number. In the case of fiction, juvenile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
books and all other books from which it seems desirable
to omit panels, these items will be put on with
sufficient space between to make them independent of
each other. The bottom of the call number should
be 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 inches from the tail of the book on all
books in the library, except oversized books, which
should have the call number at the top (Fig. 16). If
panels are used, the author's name should be near the
bottom of the first panel, the title in the second,
volume number in the fourth and call number in the
fifth (Fig. 15).</p>

<p>If two books are bound together, letter, author
and title of the second book in the third panel (Fig.
17).</p>

<p>When a work is in more than one volume with
separate titles for each volume, place the author's
name in the first panel, general title in the second,
volume in the third and the title of the particular
volume in the fourth (Fig. 18).</p>

<p>If six panels are used, each item is dropped one
panel.</p>

<p>In most cases the author's last name is sufficient,
but occasionally it may be necessary to use initials to
distinguish between authors having the same name.
Use both surnames of joint authors (Fig. 19). For
pseudonyms use the form adopted by the cataloging
department. For example, if the catalog entry is
under Clemens instead of Twain, letter Clemens on
the book. Both real name and pseudonym may be
put on the back, but it does not seem necessary. In
the case of the classics add the name of translator
or editor in the panel under the title (Fig. 20).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span></p>

</div>


<p>When the names of foreign cities or countries must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
be placed in the author panel, use the English form.
Names of government departments, bureaus, etc.,
should be inverted if necessary to bring the distinctive
word first. For example, use Health bureau, not
Bureau of health.</p>

<p>In lettering titles it is seldom desirable to omit
the first part of the title in order to use words which
are more distinctive, in other words, to use a binder's
title. If it is necessary it should be done with
care and discrimination. Ordinarily, give first words,
omitting articles. Very long titles must be condensed,
sometimes at the expense of clearness.</p>

<p>Proceedings of organizations which meet in different
cities should have the name of the place of
the meeting lettered in the third panel (Fig. 21).</p>

<p>On periodicals, the author panel is left vacant and
the title of the periodical given in full in the second
panel. Here it is never permissible to omit first words,
except articles. Letter "American review of reviews,"
not "Review of reviews." In case of foreign
periodicals it may be necessary to place a sub-title in
the third panel when a periodical is issued in two or
more parts and each part bound separately with a
distinct title page. With this exception, leave the
third panel vacant and letter date and volume number
in the fourth panel. Place first the months covered
by the volume, followed by the year (Figs. 22 and 23.)
Use the first three letters of each month, except June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and July, which should be given in full. On foreign
periodicals use the English abbreviations for months.
If the volume covers the calendar year the months
may be omitted (Fig. 24). In the same panel place
the volume number beneath the year.</p>

<p>If the periodical has more than one series give
dates and total volume number, placing underneath
the series number and volume of series (Fig 25).</p>

<p>If the unbound volume of a periodical is too large
to be bound in one book, bind it in two volumes and
letter the exact months in each part, placing "Part 1"
and "Part 2" underneath the volume number (Fig.
26).</p>

<p>If two volumes are bound in one give the inclusive
volume numbers (Fig. 27).</p>

<p>In the case of periodicals having more than one
series and which are indexed in Poole's index or
the Readers' guide, the volume number given first
should correspond with the one given in the indexes.</p>

<p>Thin volumes must be lettered lengthwise in the
same order as outlined above. Always letter from
head to tail. This facilitates reading on the shelves,
since shelves are naturally read from left to right. In
lettering lengthwise place the book number below the
class number, if there is room, if not, after the class
number with a hyphen between (Fig. 28).</p>

<p>Oversized books which must be shelved on their
sides should also be lettered from head to tail.</p>

<p>If the book is an index complete in itself letter
the word "Index" in the fourth panel, followed by<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>
the inclusive volume numbers covered by the index
(Fig. 29).</p>

<p>If a periodical index covering several volumes is
included at the end of one of the volumes, place the
word Index and the inclusive volume numbers underneath
the dates and regular volume number (Fig. 30).</p>

<p>Other questions are sure to arise, but they can
be solved satisfactorily if it be remembered that the
essentials are definiteness and clearness.</p>

<h3>BINDING RECORDS AND ROUTINE</h3>


<p>Binding records must be as simple as possible, but
they should</p>

<p>1. Instruct the binder.</p>

<p>2. Show what books are in the bindery and when
they were sent.</p>

<p>3. Show how previous volumes of a set have
been bound.</p>

<p>4. Act as a check on books when returned.</p>

<p>5. Show the cost of binding.</p>

<p>Some librarians keep a record of all books bound,
called a "binding book." To the writer the need of
a permanent register of books bound is not apparent.
It is much easier to keep in other ways a record of
books actually in the bindery and after the books
have been bound and returned to the library the value
of having the fact recorded in any other place than on
the accession book is negligible. In the case of
popular books easily replaced we may even question
the necessity of recording in the accession book the
fact that a book has been bound. Any other permanent
record seems useless.</p>

<p>1. When books are sent to the bindery the binder
must be told:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> In what material each book is to be bound.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> How each book is to be lettered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span></p>
<p>The best way to indicate lettering, etc., has been
shown in the chapter "Preparing for the bindery."
The designation of material and color can frequently
be done by giving a blanket order if the books are of
the same character. For example, if all the books
are fiction it is perfectly feasible to send a written
order, stating that they are all to be bound in half
brown cowhide with red cloth sides, French joints, etc.
If the shipment is a miscellaneous one of periodicals,
reference books, fiction and juvenile books it may
be necessary to state on the binding slips how each
book is to be bound.</p>

<p>2. For public libraries the question of keeping a
record of books that are in the bindery is a simple
one. The use of book cards for charging purposes
is practically universal. All that is necessary is to
remove the book card from the book, stamp the name
or first initial of the binder's name and the date after
the last charging date (Z25Ap14), and file the cards
just as they are filed at the loan desk. If a book
cannot be found on the shelves or in circulation, it
takes but a few seconds to discover whether or not
it is in the bindery. When the book is returned the
card is replaced in the book. This is the easiest way
of keeping this record and shows at once how many
times a book circulated in the publisher's covers before
it needed to be bound.</p>

<p>For books which have no book cards, such as
reference books and periodicals, it will be necessary
to write a slip which can be filed as a record with
the book cards. If a binding slip must be sent to the
bindery, by using carbon paper both slips can be made
at the same time. The binder should be notified if<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
books have not been returned; if unable to find them
he must pay for them.</p>

<p>It is possible that some may think this method of
keeping records unduly lax; that without a permanent
record in book form many errors will creep in and
that books will be lost. The answer to such a criticism
is that in the Wilmington Institute Free Library
it has worked for a period of ten years. During that
time more than 25,000 volumes have been bound by
five different binders, and the writer does not recall
that a single volume has gone astray or that there
have been any errors which would have been avoided
if a record had been kept which required a careful
invoicing of each volume sent to the bindery. When
the books are shipped a statement is sent to the
binder that so many volumes are in the shipment and
it is his business to keep the books in this shipment
together and return all at the same time. It is his
responsibility, not that of the librarian.</p>

<p>3. Records showing how previous volumes of a
set are bound should be kept as outlined under "Preparing
for the bindery," page 140. The binding
slip for the last volume of the periodical will show
how it is bound. As an alternative to the carbon slip
for periodicals it may be possible to keep a record of
volumes in the bindery on the periodical checklist, if
that be kept on sheets. A similar record should be
kept for all books with volume numbers. For example,
if volume 10 of Smith's works comes to the
binding assistant a binding slip should be made out
which records the material and color in which the
book is to be bound, together with exact lettering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
used. When returned from the bindery this slip
should be filed and referred to when another volume
of the same work needs to be bound. Unless this is
done it will be necessary to go to the shelves to see
whether other volumes have been bound. If only
one volume has been bound and that is in the hands
of a reader it will be necessary to wait until it is
returned, all of which means loss of time. No book
with a volume number should be sent to the bindery
without consulting the file of binding slips. If there
is no record that a previous volume has been bound
it may be advisable for the assistant to go to the
shelves to see if there are other volumes of the same
set which need binding. It is little more work to send
five volumes than to send one.</p>

<p>4. From what has been said it can readily be
seen what sort of a check is placed upon the binder.
Books sent to him are charged to him as if delivered
to a borrower. If he does not return them he must
pay for them. Let the method be elaborate or simple,
this is all that it amounts to. It behooves the
librarian, therefore, to make his charging as simple as
is compatible with safety.</p>

<p>5. Records of cost may be kept in various ways,
but the essential facts which it is best to record are:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Number of volumes rebound;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Number newly bound;</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Number resewed or recased;</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Number repaired at the library;</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Total cost.</p>

<p>If desired, the cost of each of the foregoing items
may be kept. A large library will also need to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a record of the binding for each branch, and possibly
for each department in the main library.</p>

<p>In most cases it is not necessary for the binder
to send a bill itemized by author and title.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient if he bill the books in some
such way as this:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"> 52 vols. Cowhide</td><td align="right"> 8 in.</td><td align="right">@</td><td align="right">.45</td><td align="right">$23.40</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 16 vols. Buckram</td><td align="right"> 10 in.</td><td align="right">@</td><td align="right">.65</td><td align="right"> 10.40</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 6 vols. Imperial morocco cloth</td><td align="right"> 8 in.</td><td align="right"> @</td><td align="right">.50</td><td align="right"> 3.00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 2 vols. Morocco</td><td align="right"> 8 in.</td><td align="right"> @</td><td align="right">.70</td><td align="right" class='u'> 1.40</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"></td><td align="right"></td><td align="right"></td><td align="right"></td><td align="right"> $38.20</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Books may more easily be checked with such a bill
than with an itemized one. The information may
then be drawn off on a sheet, allowing a column for
each material and size, monthly and yearly statistics
being easily compiled from these sheets. If it is the
policy of the library to send an itemized invoice of
books to be bound the binder should return the invoice
with prices for each volume added.</p>

<p>In large libraries, such as the large college and
reference libraries and public libraries with many
branches, more elaborate binding records than those
just outlined are necessary. College libraries, which
do not as a rule have book cards, will find it necessary
to make out a slip of one kind or another for charging
purposes. In large library systems books should be
sent directly from the branch to the binder and returned
to the branch. A record should be sent to the
head of the binding department at the main library,
showing the number of volumes sent with the date,
also the date when the books were returned to the
branch. Each branch should, of course, keep records<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>
in much the same way as a single small library, but
the needs of statistics require further records at the
main library.</p>

<p>It is probable that each large library will have to
work out forms suitable for its own needs, but the
following are suggested as feasible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i162.jpg" width="350" height="370" alt="Binding slip. Size 6x4 in." title="">
<span class="caption">Binding slip. Size 6x4 in.</span>
</div>

<p>Material and color are indicated on the left by
underlining. Author, title, volume number, etc., are
written in proper panels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i163a.jpg" width="350" height="215" alt="Size 5  3 in." title="">
<span class="caption">Size 5  3 in.</span>
</div>
<p>This slip is filled out by the branch librarian and
sent to supervisor of binding, who decides who shall
bind the books and sends the order to the binder.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i163b.jpg" width="350" height="248" alt="Size 5  3 in." title="">
<span class="caption">Size 5  3 in.</span>
</div>

<p>When books are returned to the branch they are<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>
checked up with the bill. If there are no discrepancies
the bill is sent to the binding supervisor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i164.jpg" width="350" height="236" alt="Size 5  3 in." title="">
<span class="caption">Size 5  3 in.</span>
</div>

<p>This slip, made out at the central library upon
advice from branch librarian that books have been
shipped, is filed numerically. When bill is received,
the information is drawn off on a monthly sheet. A
similar slip can be used to keep records for each
branch separately.</p>

<p>The weekly or monthly statistics sheets ought to
give in vertical columns the number of volumes and
cost of each kind of binding and repair work used
by the library. They will include one-half cowhide,
one-half morocco, library buckram, one-half duck,
reinforcing, recasing, lettering, etc. The first column
at the left will have the names of different departments
and branches. The last column on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
will give the total expenditure for each department
and branch, and the footings of columns will give the
cost of each kind of work. If necessary this sheet
can also indicate number of volumes rebound and the
number of volumes newly bound.</p>


<h3>BINDING ROUTINE</h3>

<p>In preparing books for the bindery and keeping
binding records a regular routine should be adopted
which should be followed as closely as possible in
order to avoid errors. Each library should adopt a
routine suited to its needs, modifying when necessary
the following suggestions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Binding Routine for Small Library</span></p>

<p>1. Examine book, noticing condition, completeness,
title pages, indexes, etc., and decide how book
is to be bound.</p>

<p>2. Underline on title page the first letter of
words which must be lettered on back. Pencil call
number on reverse of title page.</p>

<p>3. If volume is a periodical or a volume in a set
make out binding slip giving volume number and
dates.</p>

<p>4. File book cards at loan desk.</p>

<p>5. Send books to bindery.</p>

<p>6. When books are returned check bill with
books to see that no mistake has been made in
charges.</p>

<p>7. Replace book cards in books.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>8. File slips for periodicals.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Binding Routine for Medium-Sized Library</span></p>

<p>1. Examine books for binding noticing condition,
completeness, plates, title pages, indexes, number
and condition of copies, editions and various
other points noted under "Preparing for the Bindery."</p>

<p>2. If the book is a periodical find title page and
index. A special record ought to show when these
are due and which periodicals do not publish them.
Arrange exactly as the book is to be bound.</p>

<p>3. If the book is a periodical consult file showing
how previous volumes have been bound and make
out a binding slip with carbon copy, making such
changes as are required by changes in title, date and
volume number. The binding slip should be laid in
the front of the book.</p>

<p>4. If the book is one of a set see if other volumes
have been bound.</p>

<p>5. For books, not periodicals, indicate lettering
by underlining on the title page the first letter of
each word that is to go on the back.</p>

<p>6. Indicate color, material, volume number, call
number, etc., on a binding slip which should be laid
in front of the book. If the shipment is all fiction
and no call number is used it will not be necessary
to make out any slip of instruction. A blanket order
may be made saying that all books are to be bound
in a certain way.</p>

<p>7. When ready to send to the bindery, remove
book card or carbon copy of binding slip. Leave<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>
slips containing information for the binder in the
book.</p>

<p>8. Pack books and send to the binder, notifying
him of the date of shipment and the number of volumes
sent as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
96 vols. to be rebound.<br>
25 vols. of periodicals.<br>
3 vols. to be recased.<br>
4 vols. of corrections.<br>
2 vols. of samples.<br>
&mdash;<br>
130<br>
</blockquote>

<p>(It sometimes happens that a volume of a set is
going to a binder who did not bind the previous volumes.
In such a case the second binder has no
"rubbing" and a sample volume or a "rubbing" must
be sent.)</p>

<p>9. Stamp carbon slips, and book cards after the
last charging date, with the name or initial of the
binder and the date sent.</p>

<p>10. File book cards and carbon slips alphabetically
by author, or first word of title in the case of
periodicals.</p>

<p>11. When books are returned from the bindery
see that bill is correct.</p>

<p>12. See that books are lettered correctly, returning
such as are incorrect.</p>

<p>13. Remove book cards from the file and place
in the books.</p>

<p>14. Letter book pockets or book plates with call
number and accession number, if this is the custom<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>
of the library.</p>

<p>15. Send periodicals and other books which have
not been properly recorded to the order or accession
department to follow regular routine for new books.
Books that have been rebound may go directly to the
shelves.</p>

<p>16. File binding slips for periodicals and destroy
slips for previous volumes.</p>

<p>17. If it is the custom of the library to enter
cost of binding in the accession book it will be necessary
to put the accession number and cost on the
binding slip. These slips may then be arranged
numerically by accession number and the cost entered
in the accession book.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Routine for Large College and Reference Libraries</span></p>

<p>The routine just given is as simple as can be
made without endangering the safety of books. It is
not sufficiently accurate for the large libraries, especially
the college libraries which bind a large number
of periodicals belonging to many departments, each
department being obliged to pay for its own binding.
This requires complex records in the binding department.
In order to eliminate as many mistakes as
possible it will be necessary to have a binding card
for each periodical and for sets. (See Fig. 31)</p>

<p>This card has a line for the title, a place for the
description of the binding, and is ruled on both sides.
On the right-hand side it is ruled in three columns&mdash;price,
sent, returned. The lettering may be indicated<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>
by vertical lines in the title, one for change of line in
the same panel, two for change of panel.</p>

<p class=" center caption">Figure 31.&nbsp; Size 5  3 in.</p>

<p>When no volume of a set is at the bindery the
card is left in a permanent file of bindery cards.
When a volume is sent to the bindery the card is
transferred to a temporary file, showing what periodicals
are at the bindery.</p>

<p>1. Examine volumes for completeness; see that
all numbers of periodicals are included and arranged
in proper order. In the case of books examine quickly
for missing signatures. With both books and periodicals
leave page collation to the binder.</p>

<p>2. Make charging slip and send to the loan desk.
Books for departments should be charged in the
departments and not at the loan desk.</p>

<p>3. If a periodical, find title-page and index (if
one is not published there should be a note to that
effect on the binding card); and if separate, lay inside<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>
the volume.</p>

<p>4. If volume is part of a set examine binding
records to see if other volumes have been bound. If
no record is found in binding files look in catalog and
order records to see if other volumes are already in
the library, or have been recently bought and are not
yet cataloged. If it is desirable to match exactly old
sets bound elsewhere, make a "rub-off" for the binder
and indicate the material and color. If the volume is
one of a new set make decision in regard to style of
binding and order a sample back.</p>

<p>5. If a periodical, get old card from "binding
returned" file. In the case of new periodicals and
books a card must be made, and the binder instructed
to make a sample back for future use. Enter volume
on card (one volume a line, unless several volumes
are to be bound together).</p>

<p>6. Fill out binding slip (see page 154), indicating
full lettering, proper spacing, style and material.
Also make note on bottom of slip for such directions
as "make sample back," "include all front covers,"
"no title page or index published," etc.</p>

<p>7. In the case of separate books it will be necessary
to make out a card similar to the periodical
binding card to be used in sending invoice of shipment
to the binder.</p>
<p>8. Place binding slip in front of volume; tie up
periodicals and lay aside with the volumes waiting
to be shipped.</p>

<p>9. When shipment is ready to be sent, arrange
cards:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span></p>
<p><i>a.</i> By departments which are responsible for the
cost of binding;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Alphabetically by author or title under departments.</p>

<p>10. Make typewritten list in triplicate (or more if
necessary) of volumes for each department; one copy
for filing, one for the binder and one to go to the
order department with an estimate of the cost to serve
as a charge against the proper department. If the
departments against which charges must be made are
many it may be simpler to list the books as they come,
even if several departments are on one page, and to
draw off from this the charges for the order department.
Where departments are numerous and the
record of each department is kept on a separate sheet
there are a great number of sheets to handle, causing
annoyance both in the binding department and in the
bindery. Two lists may be sent to the binder so that
he may add prices to one when the books are returned.
This saves his time and also that of the binding assistant.</p>

<p>11. Stamp date on the binding card in the column
marked "sent."</p>

<p>12. Stamp name of binder on binding card if the
work is divided among different binders.</p>

<p>If all the work of the library goes to one binder
this will not be necessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span></p>
<p>13. Ship the books.</p>

<p>14. File one copy of the list made out as noted
in No. 10, send one copy to the binder, and add the
estimated cost to the third list which is sent to the
order department.</p>

<p>15. File cards in "binding sent" file.</p>

<p>16. When books are returned itemized bills are
sent by the binder made out to each department.</p>

<p>17. Check books with the bills, arranging books
in order of bills.</p>

<p>18. Take cards out of "binding sent" file in order
of bills so that bills, books and cards are in the same
order.</p>

<p>19. Compare lettering with slip to see if correct,
lay aside such as are incorrect to be returned to the
binder. Destroy slips.</p>

<p>20. See if charge is correct and enter on binding
card in column marked "price." If there is a sample
back, enter the cost and letters "S. B." above the
line of the volume for which it is made.</p>

<p>21. Stamp date of bill on card in column marked
"returned."</p>

<p>22. Stamp date of bill and cost in book on first
recto after title page: "27 June 1914 Binding 75."</p>

<p>23. Send books to the cataloging department for
cataloging, shelf-listing, etc.</p>

<p>24. Draw off on statistics sheet number of volumes
and cost.</p>

<p>25. Send bills to the order department.</p>

<p>26. File cards for periodicals and all books with
volume numbers in permanent file. Destroy cards for
single books.</p>

<h3>REPAIRING, RECASING, RECOVERING, ETC.</h3>


<p>Practically all repairs to a book short of rebinding
should be made in the library, since the work requires
little space and no machinery, and the books may
speedily be replaced on the shelves for general use.
Large or medium sized libraries can well afford to
hire one or more girls as menders, while the small
library must utilize the spare time of regular assistants.</p>

<p>When books are sent to the binding department
they should be sorted into the following groups:</p>

<p>Books to be (<i>a</i>) rebound, (<i>b</i>) recased, (<i>c</i>) recovered,
(<i>d</i>) mended, (<i>e</i>) discarded; to have (<i>f</i>) new
sides, (<i>g</i>) new labels, (<i>h</i>) new book cards or pockets.</p>

<p>When menders are employed all except those in
the first group may be cared for in the library.</p>

<p>In sorting the books the question of whether to
rebind or repair at the library must be decided for
all books, except those in the discarded class and those
which need new records (tags, pockets, book cards,
etc.). The decision is not always an easy one to
make. The kind of library in question, whether
public, college, subscription, etc., will influence the
decision, as well as the actual condition of the book.
A few general rules about mending may help in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
making decisions.</p>

<p>1. If the book has never been rebound and in all
probability must go to the bindery in a few months'
time, send to the bindery at once. Mending not only
adds nothing to the life of this book, but may easily
shorten it.</p>

<p>2. Mend books which have been rebound once
but which it would not pay to rebind again. Judicious
mending of such books may keep them in service for
a long time, but there comes a day when the use
gained does not pay for the time put upon them.</p>

<p>3. Mend books which have nearly outlived their
usefulness or which are to be withdrawn absolutely
when worn out. The question need be decided only
when the book is fairly clean, for if very soiled it
should be withdrawn at once.</p>

<p>4. Mend books which must be on the library
shelves, but which are seldom used.</p>

<p>5. Mend books printed on heavily loaded papers
which will not pay to rebind. There are, unfortunately,
many of them.</p>

<p>6. Mending cannot be done if the sewing is completely
broken, though it is sometimes possible to
insert signatures which are loose.</p>

<p>7. Books with broken corners must be rebound.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>8. Recase books which have sewing intact and
covers in good condition, if they will be used comparatively
seldom.</p>

<p>9. Recover books which have worn covers but
firm sewing.</p>


<h3>MENDING MATERIALS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Adhesives</span></p>

<p><i>Paste.</i> Home-made pastes are cheapest. While
there are various recipes for paste, either of the
following will give satisfaction:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="center" colspan="2">(1)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Wheat flour,</td><td align="right">8 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered alum,</td><td align="right">1/4 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Glycerine,</td><td align="right"> 1-1/2 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Oil wintergreen,</td><td align="right"> 1 dram.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td><td align="right">1-1/2 pts.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Dissolve the alum in water and mix gradually
with the flour into a smooth, thin paste; cook in a
double boiler until smooth and clear; take from the
fire and add the glycerine and oil of wintergreen.
This quantity will make about one quart. If after
standing a day a watery fluid collects, stir it into
the paste. Keep this paste covered.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="center" colspan="2">(2)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1/4</td><td align="left">pound of flour (1 cup).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1</td><td align="left">teaspoonful of alum, dissolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1</td><td align="left">generous fourth teaspoonful of oil of clove.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">4</td><td align="left">cups of boiling water.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Mix the flour well with a little cold water, beating
until perfectly smooth. Add the alum dissolved in
a little cold water. Pour on two cups of the boiling
water, strain through a wire sieve. Add the remainder
of the boiling water and cook, stirring
constantly until partially clear. Add the oil of clove<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
and put into a clean, covered earthen jar. The paste
thickens as it cools. Take out small quantities for
use. The materials for this paste cost less than 2
cents for a hundred books.</p>

<p>To all pastes it is best to add a spoonful of carbolic
acid or formaldehyde to prevent spoiling. A small
quantity of corrosive sublimate will make paste
unattractive to bugs.</p>

<p>Although home-made pastes are cheapest, they
are a bother to make and the saving of expense over
commercial pastes is not worth while except in the
very small library. Besides paste in bulk which can
be obtained from the local binder there are many
kinds of commercial paste. Some may be bought
in powders; others, designed primarily for mounting
photographs, in glass jars; still others in cans
ready to use. The powders are cheap, keep indefinitely,
but when needed must be mixed with water,
and as a rule are not very satisfactory. Higgins'
and other photo-mounting pastes are expensive and
dry too quickly, but keep indefinitely. In the long
run the most satisfactory pastes are those in tin cans
with tight lids; these are ready to use, do not dry
up and the preservative which they contain keeps
them indefinitely. The Arabol Manufacturing Company,
100 William Street, New York, makes several
varieties. Their "Sphinx" paste, which gives excellent
satisfaction, can be bought in six one-gallon
can lots at 75 cents a gallon, f. o. b., and in larger
quantities at slightly reduced rates. Great care should
be used to avoid having the paste so thin that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
makes the paper stretch.</p>

<p>Although paste is a necessity in every library,
there is a tendency to use too much of it, and to
use it when it is not necessary. Ordinarily it will
injure the book less than other adhesives, but it
should be used sparingly on books that must be
rebound. When applied to the backs of loose signatures
they become brittle; then when the book goes
to the bindery a much larger amount must be cut
from the back than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p>If paste is to be applied to part of the paper
only, the easiest way is to lay the paper on a board,
place another piece of paper over it, leaving exposed
the surface to which paste is to be applied. It can
be spread more evenly with the finger, faster with a
soft, long-handled brush. The larger libraries will
find a pasting-machine a great time-saver. Book
labels, book pockets, new end papers to freshen soiled
books&mdash;anything which needs to have the entire surface
covered&mdash;is pasted on the machine in one-tenth
the time required by hand.</p>

<p><i>Glue.</i> For ordinary mending, glue should never
be used. (See Materials, <a href="#Page_82">p. 82.</a>) Flexible glue, however,
is a necessity for recasing and recovering books.
It keeps indefinitely, can be used easily by those
who acquire the knack of using it, and it sticks everlastingly.</p>

<p><i>Mucilage.</i> Mucilage has no real place in a
library. If paste is not the suitable material to use,
substitute flexible glue, never mucilage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cloth</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cheesecloth.</i> This well-known cloth is used when
pressing down paper or book labels after they have
been pasted and applied, and for quickly cleaning
the hands of superfluous paste or glue. It should
be cut in pieces of convenient size and not used many
times before being discarded.</p>

<p><i>Jaconet.</i> A thin, strong muslin will be needed for
guarding sections and occasionally for forming joints.
Jaconet is the best and may be obtained from a few
library binders.</p>

<p><i>Canton flannel.</i> A medium grade of this cloth is
used for back-lining.</p>

<p><i>Book cloth.</i> If recovering or re-siding is done
the library must have a supply of book cloths in the
shades preferred. For re-siding, any cloth in grade 1
(see page 75) is sufficiently good. For recovering
cloths in the grade which meets the requirements of
the Bureau of Standards are none too good. If much
recovering is done it is best to buy the cloth by the
piece.</p>

<p><i>Crepeline.</i> This very thin cotton cloth, also called
mousseline, through which print is easily read, is
sometimes pasted over the entire surface of pages
which receive very hard usage, and which would
otherwise be literally thumbed to pieces long before
the rest of the book.</p>

<p><i>Specially prepared cloth.</i> The Gaylord Bros., of
Syracuse, and the Multum in Parvo Binder Co., of
Philadelphia, manufacture hinges made of cloth.
While these are often useful they cannot be used under
any and all conditions, as one might be led to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
from the claims of the manufacturers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Papers</span></p>

<p><i>Onion skin.</i> Onion skin is a very thin, tough
paper, used for mending torn pages, illustrations, etc.,
where print must show through. While it may be
obtained gummed on one side, very little is gained,
for it is nearly as easy to paste the ungummed onion
skin as to moisten the gummed. For tears which do
not run into the text; a thin, strong bond paper will
be satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Kraft or manila paper.</i> A 30x40 60-pound kraft
paper makes good end papers in recasing and recovering.
A 70-pound manila paper may be used instead
of kraft, if desired.</p>

<p><i>Red rope manila.</i> This is a very strong, tough
fibred cardboard which may sometimes be used as
covers for books that it will scarcely pay to put
into stouter covers. It may be obtained in several
weights, the lighter weights being sufficiently strong
for library use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thread</span></p>

<p>Even if no resewing is done, thread is necessary
for making various repairs. The best are Hayes'
linen thread No. 25, and Barbour's No. 40.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ammonia</span></p>

<p>This is necessary for breaking down surfaces of
highly glazed cloths so that labels will stick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shellac</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>After labels or the backs of books have been lettered
in white or black ink they should have a covering
of shellac. A supply of the best white shellac may
be obtained from the local paint dealer.</p>

<p>Occasional use is found for various other materials,
such as powdered pumice stone, sponge rubber, India
rubber erasers and art gum.</p>


<h3>TOOLS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Folders</span></p>

<p>Several binder's bone folders, costing fifteen cents
each, should be kept in the binding department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knives</span></p>

<p>A long knife, broad at the point, thin-bladed but
dull, is needed for cutting paper after it is folded and
for various other uses. A sharp, pointed knife is
needed for removing books from the covers, or old
labels from the back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scissors</span></p>

<p>Long, thin-bladed, best quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Needles</span></p>

<p>Regular book-sewing needles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer</span></p>

<p>A broad-faced hammer may be required for beating
down the backs of sections, or the entire book
when it is difficult to replace it in its old cover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Press</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Books wet with paste or glue must be pressed. An
old-fashioned letter-press which screws down by hand
will answer all purposes in a small library. As they
are now out-of-date, second-hand ones can be purchased
for a small sum. There are one or two inexpensive
small presses which are not so heavy as the
letter-press, but which hold a larger number of books
and are fairly satisfactory. The most satisfactory press
is a stationary one which holds a number of books
and which will exert great pressure. On account of
lack of space and the cost it is inadvisable to use this
in a mending room, and makeshifts are generally
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Press-board</span></p>

<p>A few press-boards with projections which will fit
into the joints of books may be necessary. They may
be obtained from any dealer in binders' supplies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sewing Bench</span></p>

<p>If any resewing is done a sewing bench is a necessity.
Ordinarily books needing resewing should be
sent to the bindery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glue-pot</span></p>

<p>A double-boiler glue-pot is a necessity if recovering
or recasing is to be done. It should be kept
clean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brushes</span></p>

<p>A long-handled, small-sized brush with soft
bristles will be used for pasting, while glue will require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
a large, round brush such as is commonly used
in binderies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pasting Machine</span></p>

<p>A good pasting machine will cost about ten dollars,
but it is a great time saver. There are several on
the market. In the Wilmington Library the "Universal"
is used and gives satisfaction in all cases when
a machine can be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cutting-Board</span></p>

<p>A small-sized cutting-board, such as is used by
photographers, is useful in the mending room as well
as in other parts of the library.</p>


<h3>CLEANING</h3>

<p>A part of the duty of the mending department is
to remove such dirt or stains as can readily be
removed without injury to the books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pages</span></p>

<p>Various materials may be used for cleaning books
which show soiled pages here and there, but which
are in the main fairly clean. A red rubber or a sponge
rubber is much better than an India rubber eraser.
The latter should never be used unless the paper is
excellent in quality. Bread crumbs rolled in a ball or
powdered pumice stone put on with a dry cloth will
often give good results. If the book is much soiled,
or has mud stains, it may be advisable to use ivory
soap and water with a few drops of ammonia, applied
with a piece of cheesecloth well wrung out.</p>

<p>If the paper is of good quality it may be washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
with Javelle water, a preparation used in French
laundries. This may be made by the following recipe:</p>

<p>To one pound of chloride of lime add four and a
half pints of water, and put in a jar with tight cover.
In a separate vessel, dissolve 20 oz. of ordinary washing
soda in four and a half pints of boiling water,
and immediately pour it into the first mixture. When
cold add enough water to make eleven pints in all.
Strain through muslin, settle, and pour off the clear
solution. After using it care must be taken to rinse
the paper thoroughly with water, as it tends to rot
paper.</p>

<p>In the cleaning of pages care should be taken not
to erase any marks made by the cataloging or
accession departments. Rubbing must be done slowly
and the pages held flat to prevent tearing. Rub from
the inside outward. All traces of pumice stone, rubber,
etc., should be carefully removed. If water and
soap have been used, it may be necessary to put a
pressing tin under the leaf, placing blotting paper on
each side.</p>

<p>Fox marks may be removed by immersing the
leaves in a weak solution of chlorine water and then
transferring to a hot bath of very weak hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p>To remove creases from leaves accidentally folded,
place the leaves between moistened blotters enclosed
between dry blotters and press. This can be repeated
until the crease is entirely removed. Sometimes
creases may be ironed out with a hot iron.</p>

<p>Ink stains can be removed by any one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
standard eradicators (oxalic acid followed by chloride
of lime). Stains from pad ink used for dating stamps
can be removed with benzine.</p>

<p>The edges of leaves on very soiled books may be
sandpapered. In this case the book should be held
very firm, if possible in a vise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Prevent Mildew or Mold</span></p>

<p>Occasionally books are accidentally soaked with
water. In many a fire more damage is done by water
than by fire. In such cases it may be a waste of
time and money to reclaim ordinary books which can
easily be replaced. It is a different matter when it
comes to rare books and especially to manuscripts
which cannot be replaced. Mr. J. I. Wyer, Jr., director
of the New York State Library, in his annual
report for 1911 describes as follows the method used
in that library after the disastrous fire of that year.</p>

<blockquote><p>The first step was to remove all covers. Each volume was
then taken apart leaf by leaf, and each sheet was laid between
print paper for drying. After twenty-four hours every leaf
was again handled and placed between heavy blotting paper;
after twenty-four hours here, each leaf was again removed
to a second blotting paper. At all of these stages pressure
was applied to facilitate the drying and keep the documents
from wrinkling.... When each leaf had thus passed through
these three drying processes, those belonging to the same
volume were collected and carefully tied up in boxes or separate
packages to wait until all the manuscripts were thus
treated.... When all were dried, the manuscripts were arranged
in volumes.... The rarest pieces will in time be
mended, nearly all will be covered with crepeline, all will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
mounted on fresh paper and carefully bound into new
volumes.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Covers</span></p>

<p>Covers may be cleaned by the same materials as
those used on pages, but the best method is to wash
them with soap and water. For this reason the use of
a washable cloth for covers, such as keratol, durabline,
or fabrikoid, is an advantage. Miss Margaret Brown,
in her pamphlet on mending, Library handbook No.
6, advises the use of a wash as follows: "Two parts
good vinegar and one part water. Apply with a
clean cloth and rub hard until dirt is removed, then
place upright to dry. This should not be used on
leather."</p>

<p>Grease spots may be removed from both leather
and cloth by covering with a blotter and ironing with
a hot iron. The same method will partially remove
paint or varnish.</p>

<p>For a great variety of cleansing receipts see
Coutts and Stephen's "Manual of library bookbinding,"
Chapter X.</p>

<p>Covers that have warped must be dampened and
put under pressure.</p>

<p>Shellacking of covers has been advocated by some
librarians, but it is doubtful if it pays. It may be
used in the interests of cleanliness on books bound in
light colored cloth and on books in towns where the
atmosphere is very smoky. It is a process which
takes some time since two coats of shellac must be
applied, and it does not increase the wear of the cloth
to any great extent. As a regular part of preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the book for use it takes more time and material than
it is worth.</p>

<p>Sometimes a book becomes wonderfully rejuvenated
simply by having its cover and edges cleaned and
a new pocket pasted in the back.</p>


<h3>MENDING</h3>

<p>It is very desirable that mending should not be
done by inexperienced assistants, for an uninstructed
beginner may do as much harm as good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torn Pages</span></p>

<p>Torn pages may be mended in any one of the
following ways:</p>

<p>1. If the tear does not affect the printing, cut a
strip of thin, tough bond paper one-half inch wide, a
little longer than the tear to be covered, put through
pasting-machine and cover the tear, trimming the
overhang even with the page.</p>

<p>2. If the page is torn into the text, and the book
is not valuable commercially, use ungummed onion
skin about one-half inch wide and apply as above. If
onion skin is not available a very thin, tough bond
paper will do very well. Use a thin coating of paste,
first putting a piece of white paper under the page
to absorb extra paste.</p>

<p>3. If torn in the text and it is desirable to make
as good a job as possible, use the following method:</p>

<p>Rub a very little paste on the torn edges, and place
them together. Then take a rather large piece of
ordinary tissue paper and rub it gently along the tear
so that the tissue paper will adhere to the torn edges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Put under the press; when dry the superfluous tissue
paper should be torn off, taking care to pull always
toward the tear and from both sides at the same
time. The delicate fibre of the tissue paper acts as
an adhesive in such a way that it is almost impossible
to discern how the mending was done.</p>

<p>4. If the margin of the leaf of a valuable book is
torn in several places, take two sheets of paper the
size of the leaf, cut out from the middle of each a
piece a little larger than the letter-press of the book;
trim the torn leaf so that it remains somewhat larger
than the space cut out of the blank leaves; place it
between these two leaves and paste down, thus forming
new margins.</p>

<p>Books that have torn leaves mended may be put
into the press, but it is not strictly necessary. When
very much of this mending is done pressing is impossible
unless a standing press is at hand.</p>

<p>A few books such as Granger's Index and some
of the Poole's Index volumes should have the first
few pages entirely reinforced with cloth. The best
cloth for this purpose is crepeline, through which the
text can be easily read. When applying it put a thin
layer of paste on the leaf and then put on the cloth.
The book should then be pressed, first protecting
adjoining pages with paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loose Leaves</span></p>

<p>Loose leaves may be inserted in several ways:</p>

<p>1. Lay a piece of white paper over the leaf,
allowing one-eighth of an inch of back margin of
the leaf to project. Paste this exposed surface and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
attach it to the adjoining leaf in the book, pressing
down firmly. This can be done only when adjoining
leaves are firm.</p>

<p>2. Sometimes the leaf when inserted will extend
beyond the fore edge of the book. Trimming of
either back margin or fore edge is inadvisable. It is
possible to turn over about one-eighth of an inch of
back margin, using some kind of straight edge for
this purpose. Apply paste to turned over part and
press the fold well down into the book. This will
give more freedom to the leaf than if one-eighth of
an inch has been cut off and another eighth of an inch
pasted.</p>

<p>3. Fold strips of thin bond paper cut with the
grain, three-fourths of an inch in width, through the
center. Paste the outside. Attach the loose leaf to
one side and attach the other side to the adjoining
leaf in the book. It will be necessary to work quickly
because the paper strips when wet will cause a
wrinkling of the leaf. This method can be used only
if adjoining leaf is firm, but can never be employed
with overcasting.</p>

<p>4. If necessary to use as little paste as possible,
apply paste to a piece of common soft string by
drawing it over a board covered with paste. Then
draw the string through the book at the back. The
leaf may then be inserted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loose Signatures</span></p>

<p>Ordinarily when one signature becomes loose
others speedily follow, and the book must be sent
to the bindery unless it is withdrawn absolutely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Sometimes, however, one section will become loose
when the rest of the book is firm and solid, sometimes
also the use a book will receive does not
warrant binding. In such cases, if the book has
a loose back, open the section in the middle and place
it in its proper place in the book. Thread a darning-needle
with Hayes' No. 25 thread (or Barbour No.
40), pass the needle through the hole at top of the
section (the kettlestitch hole) in such a way as to
bring it out at the top of the book between the book
and the loose back. Draw thread through, allowing a
few inches to remain inside the section. Drop needle
through the loose back, insert it from the back
through the kettlestitch hole at tail of the book. The
thread can then be tied to the thread projecting at
the upper kettlestitch hole. This is a makeshift, but
may answer if the book is not to receive hard usage.
If the back of the signature is badly worn, mend it
by guarding with jaconet on the outside, or by pasting
a strip of bond paper down through the center of the
fold.</p>

<p><i>Tight Backs</i></p>

<p>For tight backs cut a guard of firm, thin cloth, such
as cambric or jaconet, about three-fourths of an inch
wide and as long as the book. Sew the section to
the middle of the guard, and paste the guard to the
book, one-half to each of the adjoining leaves. Press
this guard well back into the book. This can be
done only when the adjoining pages are securely held.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loose Joints</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>It frequently happens that a book in the original
publisher's cover becomes loose at the joint, because
the super used as back-lining cannot stand the strain
put upon it. Ordinarily, a book defective in this
manner should be bound at once; but if it is deemed
best to attempt mending it, a strip of jaconet should
be cut 1-1/4 inches wide and the length of the book.
Paste one-half of this to the cover and the other to
the adjoining fly-leaf, thus transferring the strain
from the super to the fly-leaf. This method can also
be used to mend a break in the middle of a book, but
should never be used if the book must eventually be
rebound.</p>

<p>Another method of mending a loose joint is to
remove the book entirely from the cover, sew on new
end papers guarded with muslin, and cover the back
of the book with canton flannel which extends three-fourths
of an inch on each side. When dry, paste
the entire back of book and sides and put the book
back into the cover, pasting down the new end paper.
This is, in effect, recasing. (See page 184.)</p>

<p>Sometimes books which are loose at the joints and
have loose signatures may be mended by applying
paste with a long-handled paste brush to the backs of
the signatures. This must never be done if it is
possible that the book will need to be rebound later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fly-Leaves</span></p>

<p>To add new fly-leaves, cut paper suitable for this
purpose the same length as the old fly-leaves and
one-half inch wider. Fold over this one-half inch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
paste it on the outside and attach it to the old fly-leaf.
If necessary, this may be used as a new end
paper and pasted to the cover over the old end
paper. If used as an end paper, the book should be
pressed promptly to prevent it from warping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Repair of Maps</span></p>

<p>All old or mutilated maps or charts must be flattened
out by placing the maps between large millboards
with heavy weights over them, before they
can be inserted in books. Repairs may be made with
onion skin paper or any other thin, tough paper, the
same as is done with torn leaves in books. If the
map is very old and valuable, it may be advisable to
use paper which resembles in a way the texture and
color of the map itself.</p>

<p>It is advisable to mount all maps on some kind
of cloth. It is best to have this done by a regular
binder, but it may be done in the library if there is
sufficient room.</p>

<p>If the map is to go on rollers, a piece of cotton
cloth is tacked to a large table, the top of the cloth
pasted, and the map placed on top, back down, all
wrinkles having been removed. Millboards or strawboards
are then placed on the map and weights placed
on top until it is dry. This may take some time, after
which it may be tacked to the rollers.</p>

<p>If it is a folding map or chart, it may be necessary
to cut the map into sections before mounting.
When mounted there will be one-eighth of an inch
space between sections, so that the map itself will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
be defaced through constant folding. The mounting
of such maps is a difficult task and should be done
only by an expert.</p>


<h3>RECASING BOOKS</h3>

<p>1. Remove book from the cover; cut out old
super from the back of the cover; thoroughly clean
the back of the book of super and glue without
injuring the backs of the signatures. Lift the lining-paper
from the back and front boards of the cover
and remove the old super. Scrape with a knife the
glue which does not come off with the super. If the
back of the book seems to be much thicker than the
fore edge, pound down with a backing-hammer.</p>

<p>2. Cut strips of muslin (or canton flannel) a
little shorter than the height of the book, wide enough
to cover the back and to extend over the boards 1-1/4
inches on each side.</p>

<p>3. Cut enough flexible glue to fill a double-boiler
glue pot half full when dissolved. When the water
comes to a boil the glue, which must be used hot to
get good results, will generally be ready to use. If it
is still too thick, add a little hot water to thin it.</p>

<p>4. Turn back the lining paper on front and back
covers, spread the glue on the inside of the back
of the cover and on the boards where the lining has
been turned back.</p>

<p>5. Put the strip of muslin in the place just glued;
then rub down the lining paper over the muslin.</p>

<p>6. Even up the book by tapping it on the table
so that no leaves will project at the top, bottom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
front.</p>

<p>7. Holding the book firmly in the hand, glue
the back.</p>

<p>8. Place the back on the muslin lining previously
glued to the back of the cover, care being taken to
see that the book is not put in upside down.</p>

<p>9. Fold over the cover and, taking the entire
book firmly in the left hand, with the right hand push
the book firmly back into the cover. This will prevent
it from becoming concave.</p>

<p>10. Crease the joints with a bone folder and rub
down the back.</p>

<p>11. When the book is dry, open it and, if necessary,
paste new papers over the inside covers. This
is necessary, because it is frequently impossible to
turn back the lining and remove the old super without
making an unsightly piece of work.</p>


<h3>RECOVERING</h3>

<p>Rules for recovering can be used only when books
do not need to be resewed.</p>

<p>1. Remove cover from the main part of the book.</p>

<p>2. Remove with a dull knife the cloth from the
outside and inside of the cover until the two boards
are clean, being careful not to cut into the board itself.
It is not worth while to remove old paper sides or
end papers.</p>

<p>3. Remove superfluous glue, super, etc., from the
back. If the book has been overcast, and small strips
of leather have been placed over the back, paste the
ends of these strips of leather to the end papers.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>
Such a book will also have end papers guarded which
will remain as an integral part of the book.</p>

<p>4. If the book has not been overcast, it will be
necessary to add end papers. This can be done by
using two sheets which when folded once will be the
size of the leaves of the book. One of these should
be a 60-pound and the other an 80-pound manila
paper, both guarded entirely around the fold with
jaconet. Whipstitch the 60-pound fly-leaves to the
first and last sections of the book, then whipstitch the
80-pound, being careful to pass the needle back
through the first section. Paste one of the fly-leaves
and one of the end papers together.</p>

<p>If the book has been oversewed, cut the end papers
of 80-pound manila or 60-pound kraft paper the size
of the book and paste on the entire surface of the
fly leaves which are integral parts of the book. It
will not be necessary to guard these new end papers.</p>

<p>5. Trim the new fly leaves and end papers the
exact size of the book.</p>

<p>6. Mark the boards and book with corresponding
numbers so as to identify them.</p>

<p>7. Place boards on the book to within one-eighth
of an inch of the back and mark the distance from
the back.</p>

<p>8. Measure exactly the distance across the back
between marks just made on the end papers.</p>

<p>9. Select the proper cloth with which to cover
the book. Place the boards on the cloth, allowing the
width necessary for the back as measured in No. 8.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span></p>
<p>10. Mark around boards on cloth.</p>

<p>11. Cut cloth, allowing approximately an inch and
a quarter all around outside edge of the boards.</p>

<p>12. Glue the entire surface of the cloth.</p>

<p>13. Place boards on markings previously made,
pressing down firmly on the glued cloth.</p>

<p>14. Put stiff paper, previously cut to the proper
size, on the glued cloth between the boards, to prevent
the glue from sticking to the back of the book. This
should not be done if the book must have a tight back.</p>

<p>15. Turn in the corners as follows: Take the
exact corner of the cloth and turn it straight in over
the corner of the board. Next turn in the end and
then the side. Rub down well with a bone folder.</p>

<p>16. With bone folder, round the corners, and
crease the joints at the back.</p>

<p>17. Put the case so formed into a press for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>18. Cut a strip of thin, tough muslin or canton
flannel one-half inch shorter than the height of the
book and wide enough to extend an inch on each side
of the book.</p>

<p>19. Glue the back of the book and put on the
muslin or canton flannel.</p>

<p>20. Glue the entire surface of the completed case.</p>

<p>21. With the fore edge in the right hand, lay
book in its proper place on the right-hand cover,
draw up the left-hand cover and lay it on top. Open
the book, rub down the end papers well with bone
folder, and rub down the back; also crease the joints.</p>

<p>22. Put book in press over night.</p>

<p>23. Letter by hand either with black or white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
ink as the case demands.</p>


<h3>RE-SIDING</h3>

<p>Many books which have been rebound with leather
backs come to the binding department with the cloth
sides badly frayed at the corners or edges. If the sewing
is good and the book is clean, it is worth while
to put on new sides.</p>

<p>1. Remove cloth sides and smooth off the inside
of the board with a dull knife.</p>

<p>2. Cut two pieces of cloth a little larger than the
sides.</p>

<p>3. Glue the inner surface of the cloth and place
on the book, turning in the corners as described in
15 on page 187.</p>

<p>4. Put book in the press.</p>

<p>5. After book is dry, paste a single end paper
over the inside of each cover.</p>


<h3>REINFORCING</h3>

<p>In Chapter 6 will be found a discussion of the
advisability of purchasing books bound from the
sheets or in reinforced publisher's covers. While it
is advisable on the whole to have reinforcing done by
regular library binders, the work can be done in large
libraries that have proper equipment and labor. The
essential principles of reinforcing are the same in all
libraries that practice it, though they may differ as to
minor details. The following method has proved
satisfactory.</p>

<p>1. Remove the book from its cover, which is laid<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>
aside for future use. If the call number is to be
gilded it will be easier to do it before the cover is
removed than after it is replaced.</p>

<p>2. Make end papers and fly-leaves of 60-pound
kraft paper or 80-pound manila, guarded with jaconet
on one side of the sheet. End papers should be
guarded on the inside of the fold.</p>

<p>3. Oversew the fly-leaves to the first and last
sections of the book, being careful that stitches are
not over one-eighth of an inch deep.</p>

<p>4. Sew the end papers to the fly-leaves which
have just been oversewed, and paste fly-leaves and
end papers together.</p>

<p>5. Apply a thin coating of flexible glue to the
back of the book and put over it a piece of thin canton
flannel cut as long as the book and wide enough to
extend an inch on each side. This should be well
rubbed down.</p>

<p>6. Paste the canton flannel which projects on the
side to the end papers.</p>

<p>7. Glue one side of the book and place it on the
proper side of the cover. Glue the side remaining
uppermost and draw the cover up over it.</p>

<p>8. Rub both sides and back until sure that the
glue is well forced into them.</p>

<p>9. If desired, the book may be given a coat of
white shellac and one of varnish, after which it should
be wiped with a paraffine cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<h3>MAGAZINE OR PAMPHLET COVERING</h3>

<p>1. Cut red rope manila cardboard the exact size
of the two covers plus the width of the back.</p>

<p>2. Remove the cover of magazine or pamphlet, if
possible keeping it in one piece.</p>

<p>3. Fit the red rope cover over the magazine,
creasing carefully at the joints with a folder so that
it will lie flat across the back as well as over the sides.</p>

<p>4. Glue the back of the magazine with flexible
glue and press it firmly into the improvised cover.
Rub down the back with a folder.</p>

<p>5. Thread a needle with stout linen thread and,
using it double, at the middle of the book put the
needle through from the inside to the outside. Leave
about two inches of thread projecting on the inside.</p>

<p>6. Put the needle through from the outside about
an inch from the head of the book. The needle must
come through in the same section where the thread is
projecting.</p>

<p>7. Carry the thread through to about the same
distance from the tail of the book and again put the
needle through from the inside to the outside.</p>

<p>8. Return the needle at the same place where
the first stitch was taken and tie to the thread left
projecting in such a way as to hold fast the long
thread through the center.</p>

<p>9. Paste the paper cover previously removed on
to the new cover.</p>

<p>This method can be used for all pamphlets one-half
inch or more thick; even for those two inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
thick, provided that the use they will receive is slight.
In the case of the thicker unbound books, it is necessary
to sew them in two or three places.</p>


<h3>LABELING</h3>

<p>Few libraries can afford to have all call numbers
gilded. Therefore it is necessary either to letter
directly on the book, or to put call numbers in ink
on a white label which has first been placed on the
book. Much objection exists to these gummed labels,
because it is claimed that they come off very easily and
the work soon has to be done over again. Undoubtedly
this is true if the labels are not properly put on;
but if care be taken, there is no reason why the white
gummed labels should not last until it is necessary to
rebind a book, when of course the call number will
be gilded.</p>

<p>Two points must be remembered in applying labels.</p>

<p>1. They must be put on at an even distance from
the bottom of the book. Perhaps nothing else will
give a library such an unsightly appearance as uneven
labels&mdash;some at the top, some in the middle and some
at the bottom. The exact distance from the bottom
of the book is not one of great importance, but the
bottom of the label should not be less than 1-1/4 inches
from the bottom of the book, nor more than two
inches. Whatever distance is adopted, it will be necessary
to have a piece of cardboard which may be used
as a measure when applying the label.</p>

<p>2. Labels must be fastened so securely that they<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>
will not come off. This seems sufficiently obvious, but
as a matter of fact many assistants who do this work
do not spend sufficient time to do it right.</p>

<p>The following directions should be followed:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> If the book is new, it will be necessary to break
down the glazed surface of the cloth or leather
where the label is to be placed. To do this, use
ammonia diluted somewhat with water. Use a
brush about the width of the label and draw across
the back of the book at the proper place. After
having done ten or a dozen books, it is best to wipe
off the ammonia with a piece of cheesecloth which
brings with it the glaze.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Labels are not put on until books are dry.
Use labels made of extra heavy paper, so that they
will not turn dark when shellac is applied later. They
may be moistened on a wet sponge or on some one
of the numerous moisteners, or better still, they may
be dipped quickly in hot water with a pair of tweezers.
In using some labels it is not inadvisable to cover the
gummed surface with a thin coating of paste. As
soon as the label is pasted on the book straight and
in proper alignment, it should be pressed firmly down
with a piece of cheesecloth. This part of the operation
should not be hurried and considerable pressure
should be used until the label has firmly adhered.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> When dry, letter with India ink and cover
label with a very thin coating of white shellac. Later,
when the first coating is thoroughly dry, cover with
a thicker coating of shellac. This should be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
quickly and neatly. If the line of shellac is uneven
the book has an unsightly appearance.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> If books are thin, it is best to put labels on
lengthwise. If very thin, put labels on front covers,
near the back. If labels project over the back, trim
with scissors.</p>

<p>If books have been used or have already had
labels, the process is the same, except that no ammonia
need be used.</p>

<p>Old labels which have been shellaced are hard to
remove. The best way is to apply ammonia and water
to the label, allowing it to soak in. When thoroughly
moistened, remove with a dull knife. Removing dry
labels by scraping with a knife injures the back of the
book.</p>


<h3>LETTERING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">By Hand</span></p>

<p>It is sometimes feasible to letter with ink on the
back of a book instead of putting on a label which
holds the lettering. If the surface be glazed, it can
be broken down with diluted ammonia, or sometimes
merely a damp cloth will be sufficient.</p>

<p>So far as possible, letter with black India ink.
Carter's white ink is the best for lettering dark colored
cloths. It is sometimes difficult for a novice to
use white ink, but it can be handled satisfactorily if
one uses a stub pen which is kept perfectly clean and
is always wiped before being dipped in the ink. Shake
the bottle often and add water if ink is too thick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Gold ink should never be used.</p>

<p>When lettering is dry, apply shellac as described
under Labeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With Type</span></p>

<p>Some of the larger libraries have found it economic
to have a binder's printing outfit for lettering
call numbers on all books, even when the
library does not bind books. Such an outfit may be
used of course for lettering author and title, but there
will be little occasion to do this except in connection
with a regular bindery. Call numbers, however, are
so much more legible and permanent when put on
with type that it should always be done whenever the
number of accessions is sufficiently large to warrant
the employment of some person to do the work. It
does not, however, need experienced finishers and, if
time permits, may be done by regular library assistants
after some instruction and practice. It will be
discovered, however, that lettering in gold on cloth is
more difficult than on leather. For the benefit of
those who wish to try it the following description is
given.</p>

<p><i>Tools.</i> The tools necessary are a pallet to hold the
type; four fonts of brass type (lead, or type other
than brass should never be used); long-bladed knife
with straight edge for cutting gold leaf; cutting pad;
gas burner similar to the burners on cook stoves; and
a frame with wooden screws in which to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
book while it is being stamped.</p>

<p><i>Materials.</i> The materials needed are the best
American gold leaf, cotton batting, sweet oil, some
specially prepared rubber for removing the excess gold
leaf, and glaire.</p>

<p>The tools or materials which are used exclusively
by binders can be obtained from any binders' supply
house. Glaire is easily made as follows:</p>

<p>Take whites of three eggs; add three teaspoonfuls
of vinegar and beat until it is a light froth. Let stand
a few hours and strain through a piece of muslin into
a bottle. If kept corked glaire will keep for some
time.</p>

<p><i>Process.</i> 1. Place on finishing bench, backs up,
books on which call numbers are to be gilded.</p>

<p>2. With a small sponge, apply the glaire to the
part of the back which is to receive the call number,
taking care to draw the sponge evenly across the back,
leaving a straight line. If the application of glaire
makes that part of the book appear radically different
from the rest of the back, the glaire may be applied
to the entire back. It should not be allowed
to run over on the sides. Allow the glaire to dry
thoroughly.</p>

<p>3. With a long-bladed knife, transfer a sheet of
gold leaf to the cutting pad which must be thoroughly
protected by screens from all draughts. If the gold
leaf does not lie unwrinkled on the cutting pad
breathe on it lightly. With the knife, cut the leaf in
proper size for work to be done, being careful to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>
make the cuts clean, not ragged.</p>

<p>4. Arrange type in the pallet, beginning at the
right, and put type in the gas to heat.</p>

<p>5. Screw book, back up, firmly in the frame.</p>

<p>6. With cotton batting, apply sweet oil to the
part to be stamped, being careful to cover thoroughly
this surface with the oil. This is done to make the
gold stick.</p>

<p>7. Apply a piece of cotton, slightly oiled, to the
gold leaf which will instantly stick. It can then be
transferred to the book, where the sweet oil will hold
it securely.</p>

<p>8. Test the type for heat. A little practice will
soon teach the novice when the type is hot enough.
The object of heating the type is to make the gold
combine with the glaire in such a way as to cause the
gold to adhere. It is better to have the type too cold
rather than too hot. If it is too cold, the gold will
not stick and the work must be done over again; if
too hot, it burns the leather or cloth and the damage
is irremediable. For cloth work the type can be used
hotter than for leather.</p>

<p>9. Apply type to the book, pressing down firmly.
The pressure makes an indentation. If the materials
are of the right quality, the work carefully done and
the type of the right degree of heat, the gold will be
firmly embedded.</p>

<p>10. With the specially prepared rubber remove
the waste gold. When the rubber has absorbed all
the gold that it is capable of taking up, it may be sent<span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>
to a dealer who will refine it and give credit for the
gold which it contains. About one-third of the original
cost of the gold should be obtained from the sale
of the waste.</p>
<br>
<p>Whenever books are bound in light colored cloths
on which gold does not readily show use a black ink
specially made for this purpose. It is much easier to
use than gold, since the ink is evenly spread on a
smooth, hard surface and the type is used cold. No
glaire is necessary.</p>

<h3>MAGAZINE BINDERS</h3>


<p>One of the vexing questions which properly comes
under the head of binding is that of magazine binders
used on current periodicals in reading rooms. The
binding of current numbers for circulation is described
on page 190. It must be admitted that no binder on
the market is perfectly satisfactory. Some hold the
periodicals satisfactorily but are hard to adjust.
Others are easy to adjust but the magazines slip out
easily, or can with ease be surreptitiously removed.
Some have keys which become lost or will not work;
some are clumsy; and some have projections which
scratch tables. All are hard to hold in the hands. On
an average a new binder is put on the market each
year with the assurance of the maker that all faults
have been eliminated. A trial soon convinces the
librarian that it is no better than others and that the
perfect binder does not exist.</p>

<p>For the small library the problem is not an important
one, since it is entirely feasible in such libraries
to place current numbers without covers on reading
room tables, or to cover them with tough paper. Mr.
Dana advocates using most magazines without binders
even in the reading room of a large library.
Possibly this may be done advantageously in some<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>
libraries, but it will depend upon the atmosphere of
the city, the character of those who use the library
and the ease with which assistants can keep all readers
under observation. Librarians for the most part will
continue to believe that a temporary binder of one
kind or another is necessary for current periodicals
in the general reading room.</p>

<p>Binders in the reading room serve two purposes.
They protect the magazine and they help to remind
readers that the magazines are public property. Some
magazines&mdash;the Scientific American, for example&mdash;are
very thin and may be easily folded and put into
an inside pocket. A binder does not prevent theft,
but its tendency is to reduce it.</p>

<p>The qualifications of a good binder are:</p>

<p>1. Ease of fastening, together with difficulty in
removing magazines by the uninitiated.</p>

<p>2. Comparative ease of holding in the hand.</p>

<p>3. Durability of surface and of device used for
fastening the magazine.</p>

<p>4. Preservation of the magazine without injury.</p>

<p>5. Firmness when finally fastened.</p>

<p>Even the best magazine binders are far from being
perfect in any of these requirements, except in ease
with which they are fastened.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of magazine binders. Mr.
Dana, in the second edition of his "Notes on bookbinding
for libraries," mentions by name twelve different
makes; and as many more, some of which are
equally good, are known to the writer. But were
there twice as many it is probable that they would fall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
as they do now, into five classes.</p>

<p>1. Spring back.</p>

<p>2. Eyelet and tape.</p>

<p>3. Sewed.</p>

<p>4. Rod.</p>

<p>5. Clamp which is screwed up tight.</p>

<p>The well known spring-back variety is, in principle,
a semi-circular steel tube longer than the magazine
to be held, to which board sides are attached.
When the cover is closed the jaws of the steel are
close together. In order to insert the magazine the
covers are bent back toward each other. This opens
wide the jaws and the magazine is slipped in. When
the covers are released the steel tube is firmly fastened
to the back of the magazine. This kind of binder is
probably the easiest of all to adjust. It is, however,
equally easy to remove, is clumsy and is harder to
hold in the hand than others.</p>

<p>In the eyelet and tape class there are holes in the
back of the cover. In fastening the magazine, tape
or cord (generally a shoe string) is passed through
the center of the magazine, laced into the eyelet and
tied. The main objections to this kind of a binder
are that it takes some time to fasten them and the
magazine is generally loose in the binder when
fastened.</p>

<p>Binders which require sewing have holes in the
sides near the back. Instead, however, of passing the
cord through the center of the magazine, holes corresponding
to holes in the binder are punched directly
through the magazine at the back, one near the head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
one near the tail and another in the middle. The
binder is then sewed on through these holes. The
chief merit of these binders is that they are inexpensive;
but it takes longer to attach them than other
binders and the magazine is injured by the holes
which have been punched.</p>

<p>There are various kinds of binders which use steel
rods or bars through the center of the magazine.
Some use one rather heavy rod which is hinged at
one end, and hooked or fastened into a slot at the
other end when the magazine has been inserted. Some
have two or more thin steel rods hinged or pivoted
at one end and held by a pin or a lock at the other
end. And one at least has steel bars not permanently
attached, the ends of which are in the form of a semi-circle,
which are dropped between rigid uprights and
prevented from slipping off by caps screwed on the
uprights.</p>

<p>The writer knows of only two binders which use a
clamp which must be screwed tightly in order to hold
the magazine firmly. The great merit of these binders
is that they hold the magazine firmly, so that it can
by no possibility be removed except by the assistant
who has the key. They are, however, clumsy and
unduly large at the back and it takes some time to
fasten them to the magazine.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration all points of excellence
it is probable that some form of rod binder is the best.
Rod binders are not hard to apply; they require some
effort to remove them&mdash;those which lock cannot be
removed without a key; they are firm when applied;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>
and many of them do not injure the magazine.
Nearly every librarian has his own personal preference
among such binders.</p>

<p>Since binders receive very hard wear it is important
that they should be made of good material. Those
which are used for popular magazines should have
cowhide backs and buckram or imitation leather
(keratol or fabrikoid) sides. A full leather binding
would help solve the question of dirt, but it is equally
well and less expensively solved by using imitation
leather on the side. In reading rooms frequented
only by educated persons binders with flexible leather
covers are desirable and are greatly enjoyed by readers.
The cheaper grades of cloth, such as are used
by the publishers, should never be used, as they soon
wear through at the edges and corners. In many
cases it is wise to use pigskin or morocco on the
back, though if this is done, the cloth sides and the
boards themselves may become disreputable before
the back is worn. In nearly all binders the mechanism
can be removed from the boards when they become
shabby, and new covers attached. This will
save some of the expense of a new binder. A clever
mender can do such work so that it need not be sent
to a regular library binder. The boards should not
be made of mill boards, but of semi-tar or tar boards.</p>

<h3>PAMPHLETS</h3>


<p>Fortunately it is not necessary to decide here the
ever-vexing question "When is a pamphlet not a pamphlet?"
From the binding viewpoint any printed
matter of more than four pages which does not have a
stiff cover is a pamphlet and it is within the province
of the binding assistant to prepare it for the shelves.</p>

<p>Unbound material in libraries is of three kinds:
periodicals; serial publications which are not periodicals
such as annual reports, bulletins of societies or
government bureaus, etc.; and separate pamphlets not
numbered, of a monographic character. The binding
of periodicals forms part of the regular routine and is
discussed elsewhere in this book.</p>

<p>Annual reports and other publications of a serial
character should be filed in pamphlet boxes on the
regular shelves at the end of the bound set. When a
sufficient number of reports have collected they may
be bound in cloth by decades or half-decades, according
to the thickness of the reports. In many libraries
most of such publications need not be bound at all, but
will answer every purpose if wrapped in paper and
lettered by hand. Serials other than annual reports
generally give some indication of which numbers
should be bound together, if bound at all. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
be no change of numbering or no completion of volume
numbers to indicate a separation, they should be
arbitrarily grouped in volumes of a convenient size,
conforming if possible to one or more calendar years,
and bound or wrapped in paper. If series are not to
be kept together they should be treated as described in
the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>Monographic works in unbound form range in size
from those of a dozen pages to those of several hundred.
Probably the best arrangement for a large part
of this material is to assign a subject heading or a
class number and keep in a vertical file alphabetically
or by class number. With this the binding department
has no concern, but there are always a number
of pamphlets which have permanent value for the
library and which should be treated in the same way
as a book with stiff covers.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the cheapest way to prepare pamphlets
not over one-half inch thick for the shelves
is to put them into Gaylord binders. These are made
of board sides connected at the back by a strip of
cloth and having on the inside gummed flaps which
can be attached to the back of the pamphlet. There
are thirty different sizes ranging from 5 by 7 inches
to 12-1/2 by 17 inches. They are made in two qualities,
the photo-mount costing from $3.15 to $13.60 per hundred
and press board costing from $4.25 to $17.60 a
hundred.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> If the pamphlet has a cover as well as a
title page, the cover should be taken off and pasted to
the outside of the front cover of the binder. In addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to moistening and attaching the gummed flaps, it
will be found necessary in many cases either to wire
through the back of the pamphlet with some kind of
a stapling machine, or to sew through as described
on page 190 for attaching red rope manila to circulating
magazines.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Prices increased 10 per cent April 10, 1916.</p></div>

<p>When the pamphlet is firmly attached in the binder
it should be lettered in white ink along the back. If
the pamphlet is very thin it will be necessary to letter
author, title and call number along the back edge of
the front cover, close to the back. If the original
cover has not been pasted on the outside it will also
be necessary to letter author and title across the front
cover.</p>

<p>Pamphlets which are too big to go into the binders
can be bound in regular book form if their use will
warrant the expense. If the use will be slight they
can be made very serviceable by using the red rope
manila as described on page 190.</p>

<p>Very large libraries keep all pamphlets permanently.
Those which are not sufficiently important
to treat as books are generally kept in classified order
in temporary cases. When a sufficient number have
been collected on any subject they may be bound together
in volumes of proper size. So far as possible
pamphlets of the same size should be bound together in
cloth, but they may vary a little if they are level on
top. The expense of binding in this way is, of course,
much less than if each pamphlet had been put in a
binder. Smaller libraries may perhaps be well advised<span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
to bind in this way pamphlets having a local interest
which must be kept permanently.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to discuss here the various kinds
of temporary homes of pamphlets, such as manila
folders, envelopes, wooden or pasteboard boxes, Ballard
klips, etc. They all have their uses, and each
librarian must work out whatever scheme seems best
to him.</p>

<h3>BINDERY IN THE LIBRARY BUILDING</h3>


<p>How large an amount of binding must a library
have before it becomes economical to establish a bindery
in the library building? This question is frequently
asked and is difficult to answer. In the first
place, local conditions must be taken into consideration.
Is there in the same city a library bindery which
does satisfactory work at reasonable prices, or must
work be sent a long distance away? Is there ample
room in the building and is it easily adapted to binding
purposes? Can a good foreman be employed? Is
the local rate of wages so high as to make the cost
of the binding in the library equal the cost in a good
bindery outside the city? These are some of the
questions which must be considered.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages in having a bindery in the
building are as follows:</p>

<p>1. It is more convenient. When books are much
needed they can be found and generally used, even if
incompletely bound.</p>

<p>2. There is less chance of losing books. When
books are sent to a binder who does the work of other
libraries also there is always a chance of loss. The
binder, of course, is responsible, but one would always
rather have the book than the cash value.</p>

<p>3. There is no chance of damage to books in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>
transit.</p>

<p>4. Repairs which are too difficult for the ordinary
library mender to make can easily be done in the
library bindery at slight cost.</p>

<p>5. The books need not as a rule spend so long a
time in the bindery. If perchance the bindery becomes
clogged with extra work the librarian can rush
the books that are needed most. If such books are in
another bindery, especially when that bindery is outside
the city, it is difficult to get the books that are
needed first.</p>

<p>6. There is a certain amount of competition
which works to advantage if part of the books have
to be bound outside. The outside binder knows that
the librarian who operates a bindery in his own building
knows something about the cost of binding, and
he realizes that unless his prices are reasonable and his
work good he need not expect to be favored.</p>

<p>7. The librarian can at all times inspect materials
on hand and see the books in the process of binding.
The bindery outside the building can sometimes substitute
inferior materials without fear of detection for
many months.</p>

<p>8. When the work reaches a certain amount it
can be done at reduced cost in the library, since the
ordinary profits of the bindery will accrue to the
library.</p>

<p>9. It is much easier to make experiments with
new materials or new processes. While the outside
binder does not care to get a small quantity of a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
material, the library which owns its own bindery can
do so easily.</p>

<p>10. A bindery in the library can do much work,
such as the mounting of maps or photographs, gilding
of call numbers and book-mending, which needs skilled
workmen. Such work frequently remains undone,
either because the regular library force has no time
to do it or because it seems unwise to send it outside
the library.</p>

<p>Such are some of the benefits, but only the larger
libraries which bind many thousands of volumes can
take advantage of them successfully from the financial
standpoint. In order to be administered economically
there must be sufficient work to keep several workmen
busy. It probably is not wise to open a bindery when
the annual expenditure for binding is less than $4,000.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which a library bindery
may be administered. Under the first plan the library
buys all material and hires all the workmen, employing
a foreman on salary to take charge. A schedule of
prices which is lower than the prices paid to outside
binders should be adopted, and the total value of
binding in a year based on this schedule must equal
the cost of material, wages and depreciation on the
value of the plant. Under this plan the work may be
unexcelled in quality, but there is no incentive to
produce it in quantity. So long as the work turned
out balances the outlay the employees, unless they are
exceptionally conscientious, are satisfied. There is
also the added difficulty of finding a competent foreman.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>
Any man who is able to manage a library
bindery successfully is able to manage any bindery
successfully and he will not be willing to work for
the salary which the library can afford to pay. The
librarian himself, harassed as he is with many problems,
must of necessity leave such matters as the purchase
of material and the hiring of workmen to the
foreman in whom he must have implicit confidence.
The librarian cannot assume the same attitude toward
his bindery foreman that the proprietor of a regular
bindery may assume. He is not skilled in the craft,
does not know about materials, especially leathers,
and cannot direct the work.</p>

<p>Under the second plan the library lets the work
out by contract to some binder who agrees to do the
work in the building. The contractor is under no
expense for rent, heat and light, and in arranging
prices this is taken into consideration. It is obvious
that it is to the interest of the binder to turn out as
large a number of books as possible. Since the
librarian has safeguarded the library in the contract
by specifying that all materials and work must meet
with his approval, this plan is more advantageous to
him than the former plan. The contract should allow
for frequent revision of schedule.</p>

<p>Under the first plan the librarian will be obliged
to buy all machinery, tools and materials, and to hire
the workmen. Under the second plan he may have
to buy the machinery and tools, but the purchase of
materials and the hiring of labor will be in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of the contractor.</p>

<p>A good binding plant will contain the articles in
the following list. Those marked * are necessary,
even when the amount of work turned out is small:</p>

<p>The total cost of the plant will vary in various
sections of the country, but it ought not to cost more
than $800. If second-hand cutting machines, benches,
etc., can be obtained it is possible that the cost may
be reduced to $650 or less. The St. Louis Public
Library recently equipped a bindery at a cost of $587.
During the first year, with a force of fifteen, it turned
out work to the value of $9,609.</p>

<h2>SPECIFICATIONS OF THE U. S. BUREAU OF STANDARDS FOR BOOK CLOTHS</h2>


<h3>FABRIC</h3>

<p>The fabric shall be made from first-quality staple cotton,
uniformly woven and of a grade known as "firsts." The
weave shall be two up and two down in the warp and one
up and one down in the weft.</p>

<p>The gray cloth shall consist of from 33 to 36 threads
per centimeter (85 to 90 per inch) in the warp, and 12
to 15 threads per centimeter (30 to 38 per inch) in the weft.</p>

<p>The surface shall be finished smooth and hard and
show no tendency to stick when folded upon itself.</p>


<h3>THICKNESS, TENSILE STRENGTH AND WEIGHT</h3>

<p>The thickness of the finished fabric shall not exceed
0.30 millimeter (0.012 inch) or be less than 0.20 millimeter
(0.008 inch). The tensile strength of the gray cloth
shall be not less than 18 kilograms per centimeter (100
pounds per inch) of width in the warp, and 9 kilograms
per centimeter (50 pounds per inch) in the weft. The
average value for the warp and weft in the finished fabric
must show an increase over the average value for the
warp and weft in the gray cloth of at least 10 per cent
of the strength of the gray cloth.</p>

<p>The finished fabric, when dry, shall weigh not more than
250 grams per square meter (0.5 pound per yard), or less
than 200 grams per square meter (0.4 pound per yard).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span></p>
<h3>ABSORPTION OF MOISTURE</h3>

<p>At a normal relative humidity of 65 per cent it shall
not absorb more than 5 per cent of moisture, or expand (an
average of both directions) to exceed 0.45 per cent, and
when subjected in a closed case to a saturated atmosphere
for two hours at a temperature of 20 C. (68 F.) shall
not absorb more than 10 per cent of moisture or expand
(an average of both directions) to exceed 2 per cent. All
increases to be computed on the basis of the dry weight
and dimensions.</p>


<h3>FOLDING ENDURANCE</h3>

<p>The folding endurance, as determined by the Schopper
folder, shall be not less than 65,000 double folds for the
warp and not less than 10,000 for the weft.</p>


<h3>COLOR</h3>

<p>Before coating, the fabric must be dyed with a purely
mineral or inorganic color (such as iron salts), so as to
imitate the color of the finished cloth, but somewhat lighter
in shade, so as to give the desired "linen" effect. All coal-tar,
aniline, vegetable, or other organic dyes and lakes must
be strictly excluded from both fabric and coating, even in
traces; except where necessary to match color, lake may
be used in red, blue, or brown. The following substances
must be also excluded: Chrome yellow and other chromates,
ultramarine, browns containing bituminous or other organic
matter, compounds of lead and arsenic.</p>

<p>The color of the finished fabric should be slightly darker
than the standard sample, which will be furnished on application,
and it must not show the slightest change of color
after exposure under prescribed conditions to direct sunlight,
or to the action of ammonia gas, sulphuretted-hydrogen
gas, sulphur-dioxide gas, or illuminating gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<h3>RESISTANCE TO MOLD AND INSECTS</h3>

<p>The finished fabric shall be immune to the growth of
mold or the attack of insects.</p>


<h3>TESTS</h3>

<p>Physical and chemical tests to verify the properties
required by these specifications will be made according to
the "Standard method for testing book cloths" as used by
the Bureau of Standards, copies of which can be obtained
on application.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
